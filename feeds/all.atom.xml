&lt;p&gt;Linux is great for a server, but it's still a challenge for a desktop. The server requires stability and minimal resource usage, but does anybody know what the desktop requires? I used Linux at home for 20 years and I used it at work for several months, so in my viewpoint the following is important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware support; you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; know beforehand, whether the hardware is supported and choose the compatible hardware; so, it's better to have a wider choice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software availability: you &lt;strong&gt;will not know&lt;/strong&gt; beforehand, what software you need for the desktop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known issues and solutions database aka community support and documentation availability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you value your time and prefer to get the job done (whether it's a hobby or a payable job) vs. fixing and tuning, according to my experience deb or rpm package formats are preferable. Hardware manufacturers distribute drivers and accompanying software in these formats, and commercial software manufacturers also prefer them. Some software is available in deb and not available in rpm and vice versa, but on average you can find a package you need in these two formats. Arch and Manjaro users suffer here, but you are welcome to install these in a virtual environment and play as much as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software availability issue is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; fixed with the help of Flatpak and &lt;a href="https://flathub.org/"&gt;Flathub&lt;/a&gt;: you can have fresh software on any distribution now, but for a limited number of programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the list of distributions I'd list the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Package format&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Stable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Unstable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rpm&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://rockylinux.org/"&gt;Rocky Linux&lt;/a&gt; (CentOS)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried 3 of 4: Fedora as my main system at home, Ubuntu at work, and Debian for a few months at home. But first, a few words concering the 'stability'. Yes, it's about the number of bugs, which lead to system faults and excessive resource consumption, but 'stable' distributions are also less user-friendly. Let's go through the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rocky Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a successor for CentOS, which was very popular among scientists because scientists need to get the job done, they also need stability and they need it cheap. I can't say anything bad about it, maybe it doesn't have the latest software like Gnome, which is important for desktop users. Debian &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian#Don.27t_suffer_from_Shiny_New_Stuff_Syndrome"&gt;warns us&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't suffer from Shiny New Stuff Syndrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can fully admit that when you need to just get the job done, new shiny animations matter less than stability. With Rocky Linux, you can also fully benefit from &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/"&gt;Red Hat Linux documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don't need this stability at home, so why not be on the edge with Fedora?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is great for servers, I tried it at home and it lacks hardware support and some essential desktop features, like VPN support in Network Manager. It requires more effort in cases that require no effort in Fedora and Ubuntu. When my hard disk died, I decided to return to Fedora. I liked Debian for stability and low resource usage, but small desktop issues are disturbing and hard to fix. I mean suspend mode works not so well, wi-fi needs time to connect after suspend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware support, some hardware manufacturers tend to have old software, so the software for my MFD worked in Debian, although it didn't work in Ubuntu and Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to combine Debian stability with the latest software versions from Flatpak, but for the desktop that wasn't enough, regretfully. You are trying to do desktop things on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu works, but it seems that it was designed by marketing managers instead of engineers. It's heavily patched and these patches bring more bugs: more resource usage, less speed, and stability. It feels like windows if you missed it. I didn't get it, I tried to fix it by installing 'vanilla' software versions. Yes, it worked, but I didn't like it. For me, it seems that some solutions in Ubuntu are dead: Snap and Unity. At the end of the day, Ubuntu takes solutions from Fedora: Gnome, pipewire audio system. With Ubuntu, you just wait for technologies to migrate from Fedora. Still, some bugs are fixed and Ubuntu generally is more stable, than Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I consider the deb package format outdated, I had to fix corrupted dependencies several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora's way to fix things is like "let's invent another system". We don't like pulseaudio, let's make pipewire. We don't like deb, let's make rpm. We don't like yum, let's make dnf. It works in major versions, but it brings lots of bugs in the beginning. The kernel is so fresh, that it breaks hardware compatibility: during three years I had two severe bugs, last time wi-fi stopped working. And this high pace of progress is not going to stop. Too fresh software? We have a new answer: &lt;a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;immutable linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding community it's smaller than Ubuntu's one, so sometimes you have to look for answers on Ubuntu (or Arch) wiki and forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to recommend anything from the list, Fedora requires less effort after installation and works well for me. If you read this, it means that my wi-fi card worked. :) We'll look at a minimal software list for any distribution and apps to unleash the true Linux power in the next episodes, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Obsidian And Others</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-obsidian-and-others.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-14T21:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-14T21:56:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-14:/2022-09-obsidian-and-others.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it smells like knowledge base, I can't just pass by&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nothing special, just everyone on YouTube admires Obsidian so much to manage knowledge and notes.

&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still going to use Obsidian, just a reminder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not opensource, so nobody can say, where this app sends your data to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a service to publish your notes, but it's not the same as a web app for team notes; it works vice versa: a web app (Dokuwiki, for example) can be installed on a local computer, as on a server but in personal mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't get the idea of the relationship diagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokuwiki is just an example, some people recommend &lt;a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; if you need Zettelkasten exactly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vimwiki and Emacs can help a lot with Markdown files: adding links, tables, and lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also recommend the services with backups included vs. personal note-taking programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="emacs"></category></entry><entry><title>Germany Transport System</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-germany-transport.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-12T23:14:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-12T23:14:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-12:/2022-09-germany-transport.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hacking through transport associations and Deutche Bahn&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German trains, buses, and routes system is rather specific:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trains (Deutsche Bahn, further DB) have complicated tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buses consist of independent associations, each of them has its prices and conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without mobile apps, which update routes in real-time, it's hard to get somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's analyze these issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the transport system works in Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to find prices for buses in a particular region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What mobile apps to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 3 hours of my own time, it was quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the transport system works in Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite clear with the railways: there are suburban trains and fast intercity trains (IC and others). Faster trains cost more, and suburban trains are cheaper. For example, the DB app has a setting "show our best prices" &amp;ndash; most likely, it will use suburban trains and buses (the price of buses is not counted in DB apps, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found only &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations"&gt;one picture&lt;/a&gt; with the bus associations, which only &lt;strong&gt;approximately&lt;/strong&gt; shows the location of each association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are zones inside each transport association, ticket price will depend on the number of zones you cross: the further you get = the more you pay. If you buy a ticket for 5 zones, but ride 6, it's a violation. Besides, each association has travel cards for a week and a month. The tickets should be sold in machines and on the buses (from the driver), but in the worst case, you can buy tickets only on the buses and only for cash. Advanced associations have their mobile apps, and less advanced have a website with tariffs only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an experiment in the summer of 2022: a travel card for all suburban trains and buses for 9 euros. It made the rides cheaper, more than that, it made it easier to plan the trip and calculate its cost. The experiment is over, it will not be continued, and travel cards are introduced in some regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to find prices for buses in a particular region&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how to buy a ticket, how much the tickets cost, and what tickets are available, you need to find a particular transport association for a region. The algorithm is (approximately) the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the name of the association on the bus or on the station, often the title is large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find which region the town belongs to and find the name of the association by the name of the region, like &lt;a href="https://www.bus-clp.de"&gt;VGC&lt;/a&gt; for Cloppenburg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it didn't help, define the association using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations"&gt;the scheme&lt;/a&gt;, then visit its map and locate your town there. Thus you make sure, that your town belongs to this transport association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you can locate the website of the transport association and find all the necessary information there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What mobile apps to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll provide links to the two apps, which were sufficient for me (for Android):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=offi&amp;amp;c=apps"&gt;Offi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=db%20navigator&amp;amp;c=apps"&gt;DB Navigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we look at the app/website of a particular transport association, for example, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.vgv"&gt;Moobil+&lt;/a&gt; to order a minibus in the VGC zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB Navigator is great, except for two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It plans the routes for a different time of the day, but doesn't show different routes visually on the time scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't show local minibusses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offi fixes these two issues, and besides, it's updated in real-time (actual movement of a particular train). Some more optimized route variants may exist regarding the price and the trip duration, Google Maps may show them or you can ask locals. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB Navigator app is great, but to buy tickets you need to register... on another website. Once you've done it and have connected a payment card, you can buy tickets easily and view the trains on the route online. It's the basic level, after that you can buy discount cards and travel cards. For example, there is a ticket "any 10 days within 30 days" or a travel card for a month, but you need to search for two points. There were no offers for points I looked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without one of these apps, it's difficult to get somewhere. For example, trains are delayed, so instead of a train at 15:55 another train comes, you take it and go in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB is worthy of a separate article, and it has some tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enter several persons, and it shows beneficial offers for a particular route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can buy tickets, which are unavailable in the machines at a railway station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my experience, it's better to buy beforehand, it can be almost twice as cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, machines on a railway station don't switch to English, but the app does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ask your questions, I have enough time for practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Germany"></category></entry></feed>
