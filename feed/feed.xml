    <title>Debian With Almost No Flatpak</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with weird misclicks registered from my mouse, which turned out to be a hardware problem, but somehow led me to changing my distribution. At first I landed on CentOS, had problems setting up a printer (that was probably my skill issue), panicked and jumped to Debian. I&#39;ll write briefly about the reasons to choose Debian, but for the most part this hardware failure and migration was a reason to migrate all my stuff, data and programs, and to consider what I use and how. I hope it helps if you have similar use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-debian&quot;&gt;Choosing Debian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from hardware issues, it seemed that the last Fedora update brought some dbus bugs. I can&#39;t prove it, for the last 2.5 years of using Fedora there were some bugs, but nothing too serious. Still, programs were crashing, memory leaks were standard and lots of programs could not keep up with the pace of Fedora development. Notably my favourite Gnome extensions couldn&#39;t keep up, and that was painful. Well, I need something with fast dnf (a package manager), but a little bit more stable, so it&#39;s CentOS Stream 10. I installed all the programs, some from RPM Fusion, others from Flathub. And in the end I started setting up my printer and failed. Maybe it can be set up, but I just want to point out a list of distributions for hp drivers (and CentOS had these drivers, but the older version, which didn&#39;t include my relatively new MFD):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/Q3p9N1GfRq-205.avif 205w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/Q3p9N1GfRq-205.webp 205w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/Q3p9N1GfRq-205.png&quot; alt=&quot;A distributions choice for HP drivers&quot; width=&quot;205&quot; height=&quot;633&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is pretty wide, and there&#39;s no CentOS. Nowadays you can install just a binary, go for AppImage, Flatpak, but I still prefer a rpm or deb package as a first option. And CentOS dropped Gimp and LibreOffice in the favor of Flatpaks, if you&#39;re interested. And these are the most popular desktop apps, you can extrapolate to lots of other desktop apps to understand the situation. Maybe CentOS is a decent workstation desktop distribution, but not a home desktop distribution. You can still install nvidia drivers from RPM Fusion, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to choose then? As I remember OpenSuSe, zypper, the package manager, was very slow. Debian was fine, but I chose some strange iso and had to remove and install a lot of packages, and then my SSD died. And Debian doesn&#39;t like messing with external repos, they have a separate article about that. Well, let&#39;s try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I installed Debian, and this time I decided to start with the printer. I opened Gnome Settings, and the printer was just already there. That&#39;s what I call &#39;a desktop experience&#39;. To preserve my SSD I changed &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness=10&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf&lt;/code&gt; and turned on trim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; systemctl &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; fstrim.timer
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; systemctl start fstrim.timer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not even sure that it&#39;s the right thing to do, I just pray for the best. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;display-and-gnome-setup&quot;&gt;Display and Gnome setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonts are important, and the defaults in Debian are strange. But Debian Gnome desktop installation includes Gnome Tweaks, so I ended up with slight hinting and subpixel antialiasing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/uH4nzvXC-L-1102.avif 1102w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/uH4nzvXC-L-1102.webp 1102w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/uH4nzvXC-L-1102.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fonts setup&quot; width=&quot;1102&quot; height=&quot;762&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use exactly two Gnome extensions, I suppose they enhance the productivity greatly, and I have a meltdown when I can&#39;t use them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/ykeUcBEE2y-1091.avif 1091w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/ykeUcBEE2y-1091.webp 1091w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/ykeUcBEE2y-1091.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gnome extensions&quot; width=&quot;1091&quot; height=&quot;193&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with autostart in Gnome Tweaks I have the desktop I need every time I log in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/AXF6f8P5w0-1042.avif 1042w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/AXF6f8P5w0-1042.webp 1042w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/AXF6f8P5w0-1042.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gnome autostarted apps&quot; width=&quot;1042&quot; height=&quot;553&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/l2wjrAE50b-757.avif 757w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/l2wjrAE50b-757.webp 757w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/l2wjrAE50b-757.png&quot; alt=&quot;Auto move setup&quot; width=&quot;757&quot; height=&quot;790&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chrome&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing Chrome is the first thing I do, it works for the websites I need, it also works as a web version for Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and I really appreciate that. I also use a number of useful extensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/G6UM9VCn_F-1124.avif 1124w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/G6UM9VCn_F-1124.webp 1124w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/G6UM9VCn_F-1124.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome extensions&quot; width=&quot;1124&quot; height=&quot;804&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s exactly one scenario when I open Firefox, and it&#39;s regrettably common: when a website uses WordPress with an extension that breaks scrolling. Yes, people pay money for someone to make these websites. Animations are more important, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a command to make Gnome open Chrome for &lt;code&gt;mailto:&lt;/code&gt; links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;xdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/mailto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it work, you need to click on a small sign in the addressbar when Gmail is opened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/kdDi55VNdM-322.avif 322w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/kdDi55VNdM-322.webp 322w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/kdDi55VNdM-322.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allow Gmail handle emails&quot; width=&quot;322&quot; height=&quot;274&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dev&quot;&gt;Dev&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing for me to do is to install a proper font for the terminal, and I&#39;ve got used to Source Code Pro. It has a strange name with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfonts.com/&quot;&gt;Nerd symbols&lt;/a&gt;, which are used by neovim-Kickstart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/WPaUC9iytt-922.avif 922w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/WPaUC9iytt-922.webp 922w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/WPaUC9iytt-922.png&quot; alt=&quot;Source Code Pro with Nerd symbols&quot; width=&quot;922&quot; height=&quot;722&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the installation was straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neovim distribution is a bit too old for Kickstart, so I just installed a binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t use Emacs much, but I have a good config and just in case I installed it from the standard repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also installed kitty as a terminal from a standard repo and added themes from github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get the latest golang I installed a binary and updated paths in &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get the latest node and npm I added a nodesource repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use gemini-cli, it&#39;s installed using npm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed tmux first, but then came across an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745&quot;&gt;comment that with kitty you don&#39;t need tmux&lt;/a&gt;, so I removed tmux and learned kitty&#39;s hotkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I updated my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ikostas/misc&quot;&gt;config repo&lt;/a&gt; on github, if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to evade Flatpak, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram – installed it from a binary and made a symlink to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord and Zoom have debs, so I used them; I use them for gaming and learning German, accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;admin&quot;&gt;Admin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating and helping some other people is important, so I use some specific apps for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AnyDesk to access the screen, they have a deb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tailscale to ssh to a linux pc and do all the work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself I use borgmatic for backups, and again, it was just there, in the standard repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I need VirtualBox, they have deb as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hobbies&quot;&gt;Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hobbies include recording a podcast and 3d-printing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#39;t install Prusa Slicer yet, and it&#39;s the only program in the list that requires flatpak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To record a podcast from the call or record a screencast I use OBS Studio, so I installed it from the repo, although they recommend a flatpak. The version is outdated (30 vs. 32 on Flathub), but we&#39;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To edit a podcast I use Reaper, it comes as a binary and just works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft has a deb, but surprisingly it&#39;s outdated and doesn&#39;t work. So I downloaded &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; and added a symlink to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;. The strange thing is, you don&#39;t need a Java installed for Minecraft to work, because it installs Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cloud gaming I use Boosteroid, they have a deb and it works, I&#39;ve played multiple hours. And they didn&#39;t pay me to mention them. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some useful apps, which are in repos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xournal++ to fill in PDF forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VLC to have a media player with all the codecs (I think you need to enable &lt;code&gt;contrib&lt;/code&gt; repo in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stow to have my configs in one place and update my github repo from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole story of backing up and re-installing, I spent the most time with the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a printer, which is relevant for CentOS only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Kickstart in neovim, as there were recent changes in neovim and it&#39;s not distro-specific (it&#39;s a temporary issue, as Kickstart is designed to be exactly one-command install)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else went surprisingly smooth if you don&#39;t forget to move your ssh keys. :) I used Fedora as my playground for a lot of experiments, I used VirtualBox and Android Studio, and I must say Fedora is hard to break. Debian is not that hard to break when you start to add repos, but I didn&#39;t have to this time as the software versions are not that old, and it feels fast and stable. I hope I don&#39;t break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is that it&#39;s important for a distro to give all the developers to keep up with it. I hope I can work well even in Debian, as I still remember those painful moments of dealing with outdated software or apt complains about broken dependencies. Debian got a great tech stack from Fedora, I mean Gnome and systemd. So, now we can enjoy Debian. I suppose Debian also got some development boost from Google, which uses its Testing branch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Happy Hacking New Year</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-12-hhny.html" />
    <updated>2025-12-22T18:43:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-12-hhny.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, have some free time during these Christmas holidays, I&#39;d suggest spending some time tinkering and learning. The feeling of accomplishing something while learning is, for me, the best feeling ever, so I have the following on the menu: learning the Go programming language, setting up remote support using Tailscale, a multi-seat setup on a single machine, and network boot. I&#39;ll describe the use cases and the reasoning behind these &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot;, so you can decide for yourself whether it&#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short disclaimer: I describe all the efforts on Linux, and although you could make it work on other platforms as well, I won&#39;t be able to help you with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-go&quot;&gt;Learning Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention of Go (which happened about 12 years ago, by the way) is, for me, a very important step in software development, because Go concepts try to fix the fundamental drawbacks of other languages. Here I&#39;ll describe the developer&#39;s perspective only – no performance discussion, although Go shines there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start with the fundamental disadvantages of object-oriented programming (OOP), which were counter-intuitive for me at first: combining data and logic (methods) and inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, a good programmer is a lazy programmer, but without clarity we get... well, Perl. Go is clear, splits data and logic, and doesn&#39;t use inheritance. And it prioritizes clarity. In my own experience, I had to write little code, it was functional and clear. So what&#39;s the problem with other languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: OOP and no typing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript: cursed syntax and OOP and no typing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript: still cursed syntax and still OOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java: too verbose and OOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it turns out that a lack of typing is a problem as well. But let&#39;s turn to another thing: programming paradigms. There are functional, procedural, and object-oriented paradigms, and the truth is that Python and JS/TS are hybrid – you can use any paradigm you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started programming, I wrote Pascal and C code, and it was procedural. I read about the advantages of functional and object-oriented paradigms and I kind of still don&#39;t get it. You end up writing more unclear code. Go returned me to programming just logic, because logic is calling one procedure after another. And &lt;code&gt;switch/case&lt;/code&gt; is finally useful in Go, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#39;t write a GUI app in Go&amp;quot;, I&#39;ve read in one book, and started using Tk 9.0. Tcl/Tk were introduced in 1989 – that&#39;s what I call &amp;quot;mature software&amp;quot;. And it has some markup language (ML), but you need to create and set up each tag; there are no function calls inside the tags. I decided to stay with Tk and generate my own tags, and that&#39;s where things got interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, just touching a technology introduced in 1989, you get to know how great engineering was at that time. It&#39;s very declarative, and the set of functions is enough for many apps. And look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/tk9.0@v1.73.0/themes/azure&quot;&gt;azure theme&lt;/a&gt; – it doesn&#39;t feel outdated at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, it felt cool to continue using this technology where others would switch to something like Wails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the UI is as abrupt as diarrhea, by the way, which I like. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that Go provides so much: it&#39;s completely free to play with, easy to start, powerful, and just feels &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; in lots of the aspects mentioned above. And this makes writing software fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tailscale&quot;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve heard about Tailscale many times, but I ignored the ads as I didn&#39;t have a use case for it. The use case for me is remote support, but it can be a remote server of any kind. The goal was to have SSH access to the remote machine, and in case the machine is behind a router, you need to change the router setup. With Tailscale, you don&#39;t have to do that, as it creates a VPN and the machines think they are in the same local network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to connect to the remote machine, and in the worst-case scenario (an unqualified user), you could start with AnyDesk. It doesn&#39;t work with Wayland targets, by the way. So you create your user account with sudo privileges and install Tailscale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tailscale needs to be up to connect to it, so some user-related setup is required – preferably a button. In the case of GNOME there&#39;s a GNOME extension. I had to deal with XFCE, so I ended up with a Bash script for Tailscale up/down and a button on the XFCE panel launching this script. And in case of SSH/RDP we need to make sure these services are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we can connect using SSH and first set up key-based authentication. Now it&#39;s a bit simpler to do admin tasks (update the system, for instance), but you could also add two enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; or another terminal multiplexer to run several tasks simultaneously and recover sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt; if you connect from an unstable network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multi-seat-setup&quot;&gt;Multi-seat setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-seat setup in the base variant means 2 monitors, 2 keyboards, and 2 mice connected to one PC. As a rule, you start with a video card with 2 outputs. You can add more, but there are some limiting factors: the number of video cards you can install, whether you hit CPU/RAM/HDD limits, and the length of cables for keyboards/mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-seat setups were used at schools; they obviously don&#39;t fit heavy gaming scenarios. This configuration is a budget-friendly way to get computing power for 2 home-office workers, for example. Wayland does not support this configuration. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/Multi_Seat_Debian_HOWTO&quot;&gt;Debian how-to&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start. Assuming the average CPU load is 0%, it&#39;s a natural lifehack for two people sitting next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-boot&quot;&gt;Network boot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network boot means having a server with OS images and booting other machines from it. It allows you to have a diskless machine with an NFS server, which is relevant for old hardware, and it also simplifies user data backups. But you will need to set up a DHCP server to point to a server with images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can combine diskless workstations with remote access like RDP to use the server&#39;s CPUs. The docs for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Network-boot-HOWTO/index.html&quot;&gt;TLDP project&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f36/install-guide/advanced/Network_based_Installations/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; are probably helpful in this regard. And yes, setting up a network server for installations is also a nice option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s assumed that hard drives are cheap and network boot has fewer use cases now, but for me the whole diskless option was eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you learned something new reading this article. I don&#39;t provide detailed instructions in order not to copy or misinterpret instructions from other sites (which are also updated). When &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; hits &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot;, it can bring happiness – so happy hacking New Year to you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to dive into the &amp;quot;toxic behaviour&amp;quot; topic, notably &amp;quot;psychopathic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;careerist&amp;quot; (narcissistic) colleague types, based on my experience. The reason I feel a need to write about it is that from my viewpoint such behaviour doesn&#39;t get enough attention and thus doesn&#39;t meet counter-measures, we just let it slip. It&#39;s their responsibility to demonstrate this behaviour, but it&#39;s our responsibility to respond accordingly. And I need to start with a couple of disclaimers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s a great book &amp;quot;5 Types of People Who Can Ruin Your Life&amp;quot; by Bill Eddy. If you have a choice to continue reading this article or to start reading the book, I&#39;d prefer the book. It was my fault not to read this book earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m not a psychologist in any way; I can misuse psychological terms out of my ignorance, so you should not trust me on this matter. The facts I write about, though, happened in real life and people got hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I write about this misbehaviour, it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have it. I&#39;m not the one to accuse, but I could warn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What causes these types of behaviour is outside of the scope of this article, and I&#39;d recommend guarding your own boundaries rather than digging into that, although it&#39;s a childhood trauma as a rule of thumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue is serious, and from my practice two things worked: giving firm feedback to a person to stop this behaviour or excluding this person from the team. Both recipes work if you have power; if you don&#39;t, you have to decide for yourself to tolerate or to run – I felt regret for those who decided to stay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t say that these types don&#39;t bring value; they in fact can bring more value than others. It just doesn&#39;t justify, for me, destroying other people&#39;s lives. If you are in a superior position and you think about hiring such a person and giving him/her a team to manage, it means leaving your team with the abuser and giving this abuser the power, including the power to hide his/her actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s move on: each paragraph in the following text presents evidence. As a rule of thumb (and as a Chinese saying goes), one can be nothing, two should make you think, three is a system. When you have three, it takes some courage to admit whom you are dealing with and to plan your actions accordingly. So, don&#39;t panic (C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-psycho&quot;&gt;A psycho&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues suffer and complain to each other about this person. A behaviour is not a one-off thing; it&#39;s repeated, so several persons usually experience this. But this is really dumb, because others can see a pattern. By the way, please note that I mentioned &amp;quot;complained to each other&amp;quot;, so they are afraid of this person and afraid to escalate the issue to actually resolve it. Returning to patterns, something else is more dangerous and more powerful: he/she chooses one victim and demonstrates dysfunctional behaviour with this person only, while all the others can believe in his/her good intent and know nothing of his/her humiliating actions. But there&#39;s a pattern: after the victim leaves, he/she chooses another victim, so you can notice the pattern over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is a drug to such a person, and he/she understands power as an ability to micro-manage and to manipulate people. These are completely different issues, and it&#39;s above my paygrade to elaborate on manipulation, but micro-management is simple: insisting on how you should do something, demanding immediate reactions, so you should leave everything and run (literally), repeating requests within a minute if action is not taken, using different channels to demand actions like calling and messages and knocking on the window – you can easily get a nervous tic from these actions alone. Micro-management is also confused with understanding the matter and asking profound questions, and that&#39;s actual competence. You feel safe communicating in these scenarios if you are competent and have nothing to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impression over being a good person, hypocrisy. Culturally, many of us are taught a lot more about producing an impression than about being a good person (there&#39;s also a significant difference between being nice and being kind), so many of us do that. It doesn&#39;t make us psychos (maybe a little bit, and you definitely do yourself a favor if you stop behaving like this). For me, the evidence is a difference between how good and how bad the person can be depending on how much power he/she has in a particular situation. And the rule for me is this: if this difference makes you vomit, it&#39;s bad. Another point is that a person can treat his/her team badly and proceed like nothing happened. That&#39;s another issue; psychos lack empathy, so they don&#39;t feel the damage done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-careerist-narcissistic&quot;&gt;A careerist / narcissistic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every task, he/she first thinks about how it&#39;s going to advance his/her career and loses interest if it doesn&#39;t. These people are obsessed with career, and it&#39;s even funny to observe that they start career-related discussions for every small task. It decreases efficiency as they require detailed explanation in relation to their career, and these discussions obviously cost time and money. But they lose vigilance, so it&#39;s easy to notice. Regretfully, too much attention to career can be normalized in some organizations, so it becomes difficult to define what is &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They try to lick bosses’ asses, and they are kind of systematic about this: they remember small personal details about bosses and their family members, try to be useful, always emphasize subordination, and leverage all the human weaknesses they can. These techniques are described and even recommended to build a career, but it&#39;s not healthy. They distribute more effort to licking somebody&#39;s ass than to doing the job. It&#39;s a pity this behaviour is normalized, tolerated, and recommended. Again, the extent is the question here, so I use the &amp;quot;vomit rule&amp;quot; here as well. It&#39;s easy to notice when actual performance falls because of focus on non-work-related issues, but these people are clever and usually performance doesn&#39;t fall. It&#39;s easy to notice how careerists spend lots of time with their bosses, a lot more than is required for the job to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They overwork a lot and overemphasize their hard work. First, speaking about yourself too much is a definition of narcissism. Second, working in a team and speaking about yourself is nonsense. Third, taking too much work and not planning it adequately is a planning disability and should not be encouraged, but greedy persons do encourage that. And fourth, a healthy KPI system in a healthy organization catches the results, not speaking about the process, so it&#39;s a bad system if it works the other way. A careerist doesn&#39;t use magic; he/she exploits the system when the system allows him/her to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics is a big thing for these persons. I mean, it is sure a thing, but there&#39;s a job to be done as well (I assume). It&#39;s again about prioritising politics over everything else, getting involved in politics above his/her paygrade, a willingness to sacrifice everything human-related for the sake of some political advancement. Sure, that&#39;s the world we live in, but it&#39;s also the amount of politics we allow ourselves to have. I&#39;ve seen large organizations where people were able to do big changes without politics or small organizations where politics prevail – guess which organization is more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So politics is a lot about influence, and they see someone doing anything even related to their sphere as losing influence, it&#39;s a tragedy, so they don&#39;t let anyone in and defend &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; field furiously. The problem is that it&#39;s not a private field; it&#39;s about the organization. This battle for influence can be misunderstood as zeal in work. I see it like this: if a person is competent, he/she is normally friendly and willing to tell anyone about the work he/she is doing. When you see hostility and concealment of information, for me it&#39;s a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These persons also are willing to extend their influence, and their own lack of competence plays no role here. If you allow it, you get incompetent people doing the job, and you may even not notice it until something critical fails. I won&#39;t elaborate here on careerists&#39; skills to blame others; the point is that for some reason the organization as a system and the managers allow incompetent persons to take the job. The moment you stop matching competence and the area of responsibility, you are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience, top management can be filled with psychos, and if this issue is not addressed directly, it spreads, because almost no KPIs show the problem, sometimes even employee turnover rate, as employees can be held in place using fear. And I also can&#39;t suggest a direct cure other than knowing people and taking an insight into what&#39;s going on in teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careerists are less problematic as they are easier to spot. But giving them what they want, justifying their behaviour makes them advance and enlarge their influence. People are not idiots; they totally get who is promoted and why, so moving careerists up erodes a company&#39;s values when they exist. The funniest thing I saw was when a company full of careerists and greedy people collapsed and they blamed each other. It happens, and you don&#39;t even need an economic crisis for this. It&#39;s just the self-destruction they carry in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We Can Make the Internet a Better Place</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-internet.html" />
    <updated>2025-11-13T13:50:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-internet.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Internet, it was made and populated by users with extremely high intellect, and they cared to share something valuable. Then commercialization started, and here we are: one-page reviews generated by LLMs and filled with ads, acid-colored landing pages, business-card-type websites thinking they are apps and failing to do... scrolling, and so on. I&#39;d like to express some ideas obvious to me, as the current state of the Internet is quite mature in its &amp;quot;commercialization&amp;quot; phase, which brings us ugly and unusable websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility and functionality are underestimated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, animation and all the &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; parts of websites are overestimated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetization is a tricky thing; addressing it directly can hurt all the parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s get to it – I&#39;ve been collecting evidence for so long...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By accessibility we often mean that the content on the page is semantically marked and thus people with disabilities can use screen readers and other tools to access it. It&#39;s a great thing, but in my opinion there&#39;s a lot more to the simplicity of HTML: it can be searched, it loads fast, it can be cached by the browser. If you have a fairly responsive server that renders HTML, or a static HTML page, it will feel faster and just better to use than a website with some heavy front-end. It&#39;s just so simple that nothing can beat it. Creating React.js and other front-end UIs is often justified by a better UX, but a fast-loading page &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the best experience. Besides, the more code – the more errors. Sometimes the bigger app doesn&#39;t load correctly, and UX suffers again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;functionality&quot;&gt;Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t justify one thing in the modern Internet: why do websites offering mostly text and graphics deem themselves &amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;? It has something to do with the abundance of resources, because they are not apps: newspapers, business-card-type company websites, blogs. If we ask ourselves &amp;quot;what do we need to deliver this content as accessibly as possible,&amp;quot; put the point and draw a straight line – that could actually be a great website. But in reality this does not happen, and we get bloatware and functions we don&#39;t need. &amp;quot;But we have these reactive apps, we should use them&amp;quot; – no. If you have a modern cool technology, its use still should be justified. We have a &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; situation: a WordPress site is default – I&#39;ve seen a dozen with broken scrolling in Chrome. Why? Well, it&#39;s WordPress, everybody uses it, it should be working. Should we have tested it? Oh, no...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-entry-barrier&quot;&gt;An entry barrier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Internet, if you needed to put something out there, learning HTML was mandatory. If you wanted to put something on a forum, you&#39;d probably write in HTML or some other markup language as well. By the way, you needed a computer to do that – smartphones were not there – so you had to figure out a way to get through all the specs of a computer, allocate money, buy it, bring it home, and connect it to the Internet, which could be a challenge as well. The absence of the entry barrier obviously erodes the quality of content, whether it&#39;s irrelevant conclusions about economics, medicine, racial discrimination, or computers and the Internet itself. And we have bots, which are able to amplify the most inappropriate conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving bots aside, as it&#39;s mostly a technical issue to identify and disable them, are these &amp;quot;website builders&amp;quot; necessarily a good thing? I look at some &amp;quot;over-monetized&amp;quot; blogs, and I don&#39;t think so. They will eventually disappear, but the broken search will not be fixed, though. The damage was done, and I&#39;m not going to even try to prevent future damage. Let&#39;s address a particular issue: a company is going to pay for a website &amp;quot;without diving into details.&amp;quot; Don&#39;t do it – it&#39;s not that hard to find someone who knows HTML and also knows why WordPress is a dead end. IT is not outstanding; it&#39;s the same as any other area: applying competence to the task. If you apply no competence, you get a bad result, even if you have money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;over-monetization&quot;&gt;Over-monetization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply believe that direct monetization with ads or a paywall is an easy, widespread, and wrong solution to the problem. Direct monetization hurts – it destroys the trust between the author and the reader. And this trust has value by itself: you could get recommended and land your next job or a big project because of it. Why would you exchange this trust for some insignificant money flow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is content marketing, and it&#39;s widely used: you have a company blog with high-quality content, and your company gets more attention because of this blog. It doesn’t make any sense to have ads in this blog. But a personal blog or any other blog could work the same way: people are not idiots – they can connect the dots between a paid service and the blog content, and they will follow the paid service if they need it. In general, I think treating people like idiots is at the core of &amp;quot;over-monetization,&amp;quot; and it&#39;s just a bad strategy. Sure, it can work short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;collective-blogs&quot;&gt;Collective blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collective blogs are great, and I honestly think we need more of them. Not just social networks like Reddit, but more profound articles like dev.to. It takes some effort to implement: you need an engine with ratings and karma, as well as moderators to look after the content, plus a policy on what&#39;s allowed and what&#39;s not. But it makes me so happy to visit these kinds of resources. I&#39;d say that since 2003 I&#39;ve spent most of my Internet time on these blogs, contributing my own articles – and this &amp;quot;community feeling&amp;quot; is amazing. Again, it&#39;s not that much about monetization, and not that direct. People can draw the line between an author representing a company and the company itself, so it works quite well in terms of content marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privacy-and-cookies&quot;&gt;Privacy and cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law about cookies was just bad; I wonder when the EU will finally admit it. Privacy online is possible when you boot Tails (a Linux distribution) or something like that, and Snowden&#39;s case proves it, as he used it and they didn&#39;t catch him. :) All proprietary operating systems, including Android, are a grave to privacy – people should just get it at some point. That&#39;s all I have to say about it, and now I use the &amp;quot;I don&#39;t care about cookies&amp;quot; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;css&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is a simple language, yet creating good CSS is hard. It should do at least the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look nice and appealing to people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be accessible in terms of free space between elements, font size, and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a mobile-friendly version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a nice-looking website shows respect for the people visiting it, and design is hard. It&#39;s a separate discipline, and people need time to learn it. Yet there are plenty of great free CSS libraries. They cover all the points above and even more, and they assume customization, so your website won’t look like all the others. It’s great to be kind to people – let your website be kind to your visitors, just use tested CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nostalgia is not based on how the web used to look or even how simple it was. It&#39;s about people following their curiosity and a strong wish to make the web a better place with technology, spread knowledge, and lead other people with ideas from the frontier of scientific discovery. People know that money follows value, but they still panic and try to pursue money directly, putting 80% or more effort into marketing. You can say no to this when you choose what content to consume, what websites to bookmark, or what to contribute – your content or your effort – to build a better Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Learning Programming in 2026</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-programming.html" />
    <updated>2025-11-03T08:55:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-programming.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at the end of 2025, so it&#39;s time to make some plans for 2026. And these plans for many people depend on the question: is learning programming still a thing? I&#39;m not working as a developer and I&#39;m not discussing the trend where lots of juniors have been dismissed and few are hired, with senior developers still in demand, though. I&#39;m talking about the value of thinking and problem-solving, as well as the ability to understand what&#39;s going on with computer systems and make the right decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost like how security rules are written with blood, history is not about having a visionary and going in the right direction (although that was true with Unix and C++). It&#39;s often about testing all the variants and learning &amp;quot;the hard way&amp;quot; how they fail, so I&#39;ll bring some real-life &amp;quot;Halloween&amp;quot; stories to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wrong-decisions&quot;&gt;The wrong decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first story happened to me in my first job. We had a team of three people: a project manager, a developer, and me as a consultant. We were implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP system (now called Microsoft 365 Finance and Operations), so it was around 2006. The situation was not standard: we needed to inject money into logistics transactions and the financial contour of the system. It turned out that our project manager had a plan which was completely unfeasible, but he didn&#39;t share it with his team. The takeaway is not about teamwork though – it&#39;s about planning something when at least someone knows how it works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no surprise this happens again: making decisions when no one actually knows what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ve been in hundreds if not thousands of meetings, and the most frustrating ones are when no one understands what&#39;s going on and, in their ignorance, doesn&#39;t want to invite a subject matter expert to clarify the issue – because, well, it would reveal their incompetence. That can lead to anything from an incident to a disaster, and that&#39;s what the next two cases are about. The new idea, common for both cases, is the formula &amp;quot;incompetent person + language model = competent person,&amp;quot; which doesn’t work out at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tea app, a social network for women, faced a massive personal data leak after boasting about extensive use of language-model-generated code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The AWS hub outage, noticed by almost everyone using the Internet: again, AWS had heavily promoted using language-model-generated code before that. A software bug was cited as the reason for the outage – I don&#39;t believe that in 2025 qualified programmers and testers are unable to push reliable code to production, but language models certainly are not able to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend toward language-model-generated code is like a locomotive – impossible to stop right now – so we&#39;ll see more outages for sure. Another funny thing is that some developers advertise themselves as &amp;quot;re-writing&amp;quot; AI-generated code, which is exhausting, by the way. You face at least 2–4x more code than there should be – code implementing features no one asked for, and not implementing security or reliability features... well, because no one asked for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-programming&quot;&gt;What is programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to redefine programming, and my definition is not in line with a basic Computer Science (CS) course, regretfully:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s about learning a programming language, but you need to learn at least one more language other than Python. Python is concise and simple, but it&#39;s so similar to human language, and the interpreter is so friendly in reporting errors, that it feels almost like cheating. With not enough &lt;strong&gt;resistance&lt;/strong&gt;, you don’t get enough &lt;strong&gt;exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, which is what working with computers is about – developing a certain level of problem-solving ability. So, I suggest learning something harder like C++, Java, or JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s about learning markup languages as well: HTML, Markdown, LaTeX. The ability to see structure when you read markup code is important, and these languages are the basis of modern IT. After learning front-end, I also changed my perspective on user interfaces: the back-end defines what capabilities you have, but representation matters, and you should at least have an opinion on front-end technologies like Angular, Vue, or React.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s about learning SQL, which is included in CS courses, as &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; is often not about transforming data but about storing and extracting it – and that may not be obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s about learning the basics of how the Internet and networks in general work. What are the protocol layers? Why would you prefer the Internet over a local network? When computers start to interact with each other, security questions arise: what level of security are we able to achieve and promise to our customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s about learning the basics of operating systems – how they function, what layers they have, and why Linux is better (just joking). Working in IT implies having some outlook, knowing some history: what about microkernel architecture, for example? And history, especially computer history, has a lot of lessons to learn from – why something &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot; works in the long term, and some architecturally beautiful or overhyped concepts fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even that’s not enough: there are programming patterns, architectures, and specific security vulnerabilities, which make the features visible to the user only about 10% of the iceberg. So yes, programming is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-ai&quot;&gt;What about AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for repeating myself, but I&#39;ll write it again just in case you don’t know: we don’t have AI yet. Just listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3zAXRCFrHPShU4MuuIx4V5?si=LO8baLI5RxeLmrm0f5vNUg&quot;&gt;podcast with Richard Sutton&lt;/a&gt;: language models use knowledge – they are unable to learn, even like animals do. Yes, they can pass Turing’s test, but it’s still emulation of intellect rather than having it. True intellect is called AGI (artificial general intelligence). Forecasts vary – one of the latest episodes of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iIYVmmhXwh3fOumypWVpC?si=B-Sk4SSVQbmi7k7hMDneNA&quot;&gt;podcast with Andrej Karpathy&lt;/a&gt; is called &amp;quot;AGI is still a decade away.&amp;quot; I’m not sure if I’m going to listen to it – it sounds pessimistic. Or optimistic – depending on how you look at the path behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-professions-will-disappear&quot;&gt;What professions will disappear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/6vBr2kDnmrUu17xdiRVbXR?si=KSjKbq_zQ_W6JTG8OTVotQ&quot;&gt;podcast with Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, although it’s boring at times. Elon states that all professions working with computers will disappear. I’d say that working with requirements is the most difficult part, even for humans. In the real world, product managers and project managers do this job. Being one of them, I can see the demand falling. Can developers do this job? Yes, sure. The great devs I know were great at working with requirements (and architecture). The work model just tends to be more primitive now: creating a prototype at each step and moving forward based on feedback. It’s not that bad – if &amp;quot;the managers&amp;quot; are so expensive, this model can even be more cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-side-history-quest&quot;&gt;A side history quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of IT is rather short, but I&#39;d like to ask a question: when did humanity make progress in general? I believe it happened when highly talented and motivated people (self-)assembled in teams and faced challenging tasks. For me, the case &amp;quot;Windows vs. Linux&amp;quot; is clear and closed – and that’s what happened (in my humble opinion). In the early days of Linux, FreeBSD was also a thing, but for me, the turning point from FreeBSD to Linux was the journaling system ReiserFS, which boosted filesystem performance on Linux. Windows filesystem performance looked just ridiculous, and from a performance viewpoint, Windows made no sense because of its outdated multitasking model. So in this case, engineers (or developers) won over &amp;quot;managers,&amp;quot; whether they were managing products, projects, finances, or marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening now is like &amp;quot;the managers&amp;quot; striking back using language models to get rid of devs. Look at Windows now: it’s clearly a follower, copying Linux tech – be it WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or PowerShell with its CLI approach (which existed before Linux, I must say). To cover Windows’ grave with asphalt, they even introduced ads in Windows – so even more Windows supporters are pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not &amp;quot;devs vs. managers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;devs vs. language models.&amp;quot; It’s &amp;quot;true vs. fake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-intelligence&quot;&gt;What’s intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think intelligence reveals itself in solving problems, and there’s no other way to train intelligence than by solving problems – always raising the bar. Programming is great for training intelligence because, in real life, you can cut corners: people can abandon their own requirements if you’re convincing enough, you can motivate people to work overtime to compensate for bad planning, and so on. IT is ideal in terms of &amp;quot;strict requirements&amp;quot;: you’re unable to cut corners there – it works or it doesn’t. It also teaches a very important concept of &amp;quot;good enough,&amp;quot; which I think is underappreciated in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are suffering while learning, you’re probably on the right path, because it means you have a challenging task. By the way, choosing a &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; solution can also be quite painful for us perfectionists. :) That’s the reason why people choose to write programs using a language literally called &amp;quot;Brainf*ck,&amp;quot; or use Raspberry Pi – a computer with very limited resources. Because you raise the bar – not by making the task more complex, but by limiting the resources or the toolset. And it seems that it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-challenges-for-programming&quot;&gt;What are the challenges for programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, what if you’re trying to create an app and you’re not taking the fast, easy, and wrong path of generating code with a language model? Let’s start with the requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to deliver fast because you still compete with language models :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to deliver cheap for the same reason – and I’m not talking about outsourcing here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your code needs to be stable and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think choosing the right framework is the right place to start. It shouldn’t be too fresh and undocumented, but it should leverage recent advancements to... well, write less code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example and talk about a web app. Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel gained popularity for a reason – because (and DHH was right here) they solve an &amp;quot;end-to-end&amp;quot; problem. In the JS world, it’s a little more chaotic and &amp;quot;DIY&amp;quot;-like; I’ve actually lost track of what’s going on. :) It’s bad to start learning programming with a framework, but it’s so nice when you already have one you need. And I’m really inspired by how wide the choice is now, especially compared to the situation just a few years ago. Anyway, code generators within frameworks – when you know what you’re doing – are far better than copying code from a chatbot. Please, for the sake of humanity, don’t do that. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else inspires me even more than the progress with the hardware and software we have compared to 1999, when I started playing with FreeBSD (and everybody was terrified of the “year 2000 problem,” ha-ha). It’s how much you have to play with now, and how many resources you have to satisfy your curiosity. Codecademy doesn’t pay me, but it’s hard not to mention their free resources to learn coding in any language, including Rust, Kotlin, and Bash. And this experience – to feel what’s on the edge of software development right now – is quite satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Forced Downshifting</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-downshifting.html" />
    <updated>2025-11-01T18:10:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-11-downshifting.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have friends who worked as couriers during harsh times, and they felt bad. Germany now goes through a complicated situation, which can be defined on a scale from stagnation to economic crisis, depending on how pessimistic you are. I personally try to find a way out, and I think that describing overcoming is more important than &amp;quot;success stories&amp;quot;, but I&#39;d like to say something to people who struggle: you are not alone, and it&#39;s okay, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. In this post, I&#39;ll analyse the most pessimistic viewpoint on the circumstances I have. I hope this analysis and the following self-reflection will help someone in a similar situation. If you can do this, it&#39;s already a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-is&quot;&gt;AS IS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#39;s happening in Germany now? It seems like a normal economic crisis: the stagnation was before, but the situation with the tariffs (auto-industry and pharma), &amp;quot;a tax of war&amp;quot; and other factors resulted in mass layoffs and the absence of vacancies, which I can clearly observe. What else is going on? Well, there are officially more bankruptcies this year than in the previous one. But the thing with pharma and autos is that it&#39;s just the beginning, and many suppliers are dependent on these companies. It takes some time to make the hard decisions, so we&#39;ll see these decisions soon. The issue with autos is that auto-producers like Audi invested in e-autos heavily, but it didn&#39;t play out, the demand is not there. Maybe as well as the infrastructure and the technology. The issue with pharma is that USA import tariffs were unexpected, it&#39;s a big industry with a surprisingly big share of export to the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the job market faced the consequences of the aforementioned crisis, the requirements started rising. It&#39;s not enough to be in Germany, have a permit and be a good specialist. Your German needs to be similar to native, which takes some more time than &amp;quot;negotiation-proficient&amp;quot; level. You also need to already live in the city where the vacancy is, which is not the case for me. You also compete with the Germans, who were laid off, and Germans are preferred. I&#39;d rather not call it &amp;quot;discrimination&amp;quot;, it&#39;s a normal national policy. There&#39;s a U-turn in migration politics as well, but as I&#39;m already in Germany, it&#39;s not an issue. Still, as the requirements rise, you can be selected if you are better integrated into German society. You understand that this society is about accepting diversity and democratic values – these are just words, understanding their meaning can be tricky. If you have a very first call with a recruiter, you&#39;ll proceed when you catch the nuances, get the rhythm of the dialog and know when to say what, where the pauses are and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-be&quot;&gt;TO BE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If according to one&#39;s saying &amp;quot;everything is a comedy in the long term&amp;quot;, let&#39;s plan long term. I was asking for successful job searches in my particular area, and it took some guys five years of consistent effort to get there. I&#39;m in Germany for three years; I have two more years to go. That&#39;s about managing your own expectations as well, it really helps not to get upset every time you are rejected and change the perspective: OK, I need to live two more years in some &amp;quot;transitional mode&amp;quot;. If it works out earlier – great, but I don&#39;t expect that. There are some other consequences as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need just to learn German consistently; I don&#39;t need to &amp;quot;push the pedal to the metal&amp;quot; to the point of mental breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration should be regarded as a task; watching news and movies is obviously not sufficient. In Germany, socialization happens in &amp;quot;Vereine&amp;quot; as far as I know, it&#39;s not spontaneous on the street using small talk, that&#39;s a common misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two years I need overlap with Germany getting out of crisis; it will eventually get better, but it needs time, so this time is the resource I have, but I need to make some practical stuff happen, meaning having any job, not building &amp;quot;a great career&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I&#39;ve been through crises, including 2008. Things will calm down, it will get better, crises are a cure in terms of companies&#39; and economy restructuring. It&#39;s painful, but it works, there&#39;s no need to panic. Sure, inefficient companies will go bankrupt, and the resources will flow to the companies that can balance the value and the cost. Of course, there are human lives behind these events, but I don&#39;t think that it makes sense to cry about how the economy works. If it&#39;s a mess around, sometimes taking a break is the best, not to go crazy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my &amp;quot;crisis survival experience&amp;quot;, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d say prioritizing your well-being and your mental state is the best thing to do. There are a lot of great guides on how to do it, but it&#39;s basically disconnecting yourself from the &amp;quot;crisis agenda&amp;quot; and finding inner resources and inner peace first. After that, you&#39;ll find out that many people around you struggle as well, and they probably need you as a human being around and supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there are some things that are just to be done regularly, it&#39;s about consistency. For me, it&#39;s learning German, for you, it can be something else. There&#39;s one viral video of a priest who said something like &amp;quot;I asked God for courage, and he gave me challenges, so my prayers are fulfilled&amp;quot;. I call it &amp;quot;a minimum&amp;quot; – something I do what&#39;s in my calendar, no matter what. I just don&#39;t let myself miss another German class, it&#39;s as simple as that. 497 classes so far, I think I missed about five, but that was never about &amp;quot;not today&amp;quot; – just in case you&#39;d like to call me on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as the title goes, is downshifting. There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of when you don&#39;t want to stay at home and are eager to bring value to a society in the way you can. I&#39;m still looking and almost ready to apply, but there are a few catches here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some low-paid jobs are dangerous, meaning you&#39;ll not have the same health after that, or there are some high risks involved, so beware;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I&#39;m selling my time, I&#39;d like to bring value, so I don&#39;t agree to sit and wait for something calling it &amp;quot;a job&amp;quot;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job should be profitable: if you have to buy a car to commute, then pay huge amounts for gas and end up financially broken, it&#39;s not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus tip #1: maintain your skills. There will be an opportunity, the point is if you are ready for it. For me, my &amp;quot;core skills&amp;quot; are communication and problem-solving. The last is pretty universal, it applies to anything, it&#39;s just feeding the brain with some tasks it didn&#39;t accomplish before and has to figure things out. So, I&#39;m going with programming courses at Codecademy because learning programming is about problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus tip #2: there are a lot of inexpensive hobbies out there, go for them. When I had my &amp;quot;dream job&amp;quot;, I just couldn&#39;t do that – it seemed I was burning and thinking about the job all the time. A side note: maybe this career break is to get this point. Cycling, 3D modeling, even 3D printing (with a used printer), programming or building websites, playing guitar, paracord weaving, playing football – these are just some of the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 I had my personal motto: If everyone around is going crazy, it doesn&#39;t mean I have to go crazy. It worked pretty well. Even if there&#39;s a serious crisis outside, there&#39;s one more crisis to overcome – the one inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>7 Sins of Dysfunctional Project Management</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-pm-sins.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-22T12:20:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-pm-sins.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are failing with the changes, the first reason could be that you have no project management processes and practices established. If you are aware of project management (PM) and think that you have projects, a project management office, project managers and so on, if you see something in common with the &amp;quot;7 sins&amp;quot; I enumerate and discuss below, you&#39;re in a really bad situation. It&#39;s about the basics, but they are called so for a reason – you build all the other stuff on top of that. When the foundation is rotten, you&#39;ll find out by failing to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-not-adapting-a-pm-standard-with-written-process-description-and-templates&quot;&gt;1. Not adapting a PM standard with written process description and templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Projects&amp;quot; have been a buzzword for decades: I go to buy some sausages, that&#39;s a project; I&#39;m visiting my mom, that&#39;s another project; I have so many projects going on, from going out with my friends to the bar on Friday night to going into coding. If it lasts for so long, it becomes socially accepted, it&#39;s for sure accepted and spread by journalists of any calibre, but it still doesn&#39;t mean to me that it should be accepted by PM professionals. Well, project implies some artifacts, to say the least, none of which are in place in the aforementioned cases for sure. The same goes for PM as a discipline, it implies practices and procedures, as well as templates, which do not just lie somewhere, but which are used and against which projects are checked and deviations are eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you started your journey into the PM discipline from the PMBOK, I can feel nothing but sorry, because this standard is vague and overwhelming at the same time, unless you already know what PM is and what you need. And even if you do know, reading it will bring you to tears. That&#39;s why I prefer PRINCE2, which is a lot more practical, down-to-Earth and applicable to smaller-scale initiatives. The templates are also great and available for free, as well as (my favourite) Project Management Office (PMO) process diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adapting any practice, including PM, is a change, and it includes making a top-level decision, conducting training, making PM mandatory, controlling the progress and, again, taking actions including escalations, when things don&#39;t go as planned (they won&#39;t). If you don&#39;t feel the pain of a change, you are probably not advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-not-tailoring-a-pm-standard-to-the-companys-requirements&quot;&gt;2. Not tailoring a PM standard to the company&#39;s requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#39;m writing about adapting a PM standard, it&#39;s not about implementing it as is, it should be tailored to the company&#39;s requirements, and it&#39;s 80% of the work in this aspect. I&#39;ll give some examples, which are not applicable in every case, but I did it in most of the cases I build PMOs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutting unnecessary steps and templates from the process; here we balance the resources we have and the risks we can take, still trying to implement something &amp;quot;in the direction of PM&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deciding how to deal with initiatives, too small to be called projects, I call these tasks. You don&#39;t write a project passport for the tasks and you don&#39;t conduct regular status meetings, but you need a decision to use resources, you need some brief description of goals and a plan, and management needs PMO to track these tasks. Tasks can be distinguished by the amount of money spent on them, by the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing the regularity for status meetings and PMO meetings, it&#39;s all about spending resources: too seldom can get things out of control, too often makes them completely boring, so your busy top-managers lose interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a cultural thing as well: you need to explain and I&#39;d even say &amp;quot;educate&amp;quot; your staff what PM is, using the cases and vocabulary, the pain points in a particular company. And you also explain the rough (and probably painful) edges of living with PM using these pain points, or you return to the previous step and adapt your PM approach further, if this roughness is not justified. That&#39;s what people get paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-no-gateways-in-place-for-project-phase-start-close&quot;&gt;3. No gateways in place for project/phase start/close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of not working PM as an approach is things slipping away. It can be negative, like budget or time overrun, and it can be &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot;, like accepting the deliverables for the stage with a proper procedure or off-line meeting. You can tailor the procedures, but you don&#39;t do it retroactively. If the procedure is in place, if I were paid every time I&#39;ve heard &amp;quot;do we really need to do this?&amp;quot;, I&#39;d be rich on my yacht somewhere in the Caribbean. Yes, that&#39;s the point of procedure, they work or they do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels right to simplify things &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot;, but it&#39;s not. I didn&#39;t allow it, but when the off-line discussion took place, I almost always heard someone who wasn&#39;t satisfied, and you need to address these issues here and now. Formal acceptance or stage/project start approval eliminates the need to return to these steps afterwards. This returning is hell, and it&#39;s a completely different type of hell than PM is by itself – it&#39;s the hell you create yourself and you could evade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who created these procedures for project/phase start/close definitely had some experience in terms of knife handles sticking out of their backs; I&#39;d trust these guys (and gals), unless you want these kinds of surprises for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being too formal with these meetings is another trap, I&#39;ve seen it. In case you didn&#39;t know, the rule for meetings in PM is &amp;quot;no surprises&amp;quot;, so yes, everyone should be aware of what&#39;s going on and agree before the meeting. And if you prepare the meeting like that, you&#39;d probably still get manageable objections, otherwise you&#39;d be screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to get this procedure up and running, you need the discipline to get all these top-managers to these meetings, as well as competent project managers to prepare &lt;strong&gt;the people&lt;/strong&gt; for the meetings. Yes, it&#39;s tough – well, life is tough and PM is tough as well. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-not-requiring-pm-certification-from-the-suppliers&quot;&gt;4. Not requiring PM certification from the suppliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PM and in management in general we often hear the term &amp;quot;team&amp;quot;, and it refers to the team inside one company. With projects, you share the risks and the activities with the supplier, so it&#39;s fair to consider their team as well. And their team has a project manager, so to be aligned with this project manager regarding the basics, he/she/them/they should probably be certified project managers. From my experience either a project manager is certified, or he/she/them/they doesn&#39;t believe in project plans at all, and that&#39;s a disaster. This project manager will then relocate all the resources to the task with the nearest deadline or do some other crazy stuff. We all have some crazy stuff to do besides breaking basic PM rules, just cut it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-punishing-for-revealing-delays&quot;&gt;5. Punishing for revealing delays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects always come with the bad news: delays, new problems, risks, changes and so on. Good news? Almost never heard of them. In this context, everything you can ask any team member to do is not to panic and to bring the news to the appropriate level as soon as possible. There should be &lt;strong&gt;absolutely no hesitation&lt;/strong&gt; to bring the bad news and to escalate the message. According to the basics, by doing this, a person lets the whole team down. And there&#39;s no substitute for the culture, which welcomes the bad news, no matter what. There&#39;s no &amp;quot;HR BS&amp;quot; to let the team know that they&#39;ll never ever be punished for doing so. This permission and even encouragement to bring the news in is applicable for the whole team, and it&#39;s a vital PM practice. People get the real message very fast, right after the trust is broken and anyone is discouraged from bringing in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-not-punishing-for-revealing-delays-post-factum&quot;&gt;6. Not punishing for revealing delays post-factum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What PM is about regarding the schedule? Well, a classic PDCA cycle: plan-do-control-act. There&#39;s something else, called forecasting or predicting, and I&#39;ll not cover it here. I&#39;ll just say that if a project manager only states the delay post-factum, it means he/she/them/they doesn&#39;t manage the schedule at all. There&#39;s no reason for that, that&#39;s the job; every drunk project manager should be able to report the critical path and the probable delays. I wouldn&#39;t put it as a practical test, though, for obvious reasons. And yes, normally I&#39;d fire for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-not-having-a-formal-project-prioritization-framework-in-place&quot;&gt;7. Not having a formal project prioritization framework in place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resources are always limited. I had a case when I suggested pausing 9 projects out of 10, because the most important project was eating all the resources. I can also confess that I could have 10 projects without a formal prioritization framework, and I regret not having it. Things just become so clear when you have it. I prefer RICE, by the way; you could also use another framework using quantifiable effects, but you need trustworthy business cases for that. PMO is for supporting top-management in any circumstances, and these circumstances can be shocking, meaning closing or pausing a significant part of the projects. When it happens, you don&#39;t have time to evaluate, you need to make decisions, and you need to be able to explain these decisions. With a formal framework, you can give the scoring table, and the decisions become clear; that&#39;s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs I enumerated sound random, and they probably are, but they uncover some fundamental things below processes and practices: what it means in terms of &amp;quot;modus operandi&amp;quot; to have project standards in place, how a sane PM culture looks like, when you fire your project manager, and how your PMO is helping the business when a storm is coming. That&#39;s all for today, folks. I wish you survive all the storms, play safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Structuring the Job Search</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-jobsearch.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-15T11:15:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-jobsearch.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that many people are frustrated looking for a job nowadays; in particular, at the time of writing, in some regions and professional areas the situation looks desperate. And looking for a job can be a disappointing experience by itself – but what&#39;s the real problem here? I assume that it comes from the lack or absence of feedback, and an unstructured workflow, so until you get a contract it&#39;s hard to understand if there&#39;s any progress at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still looking for a job, and I&#39;m not an expert of any kind in this area, yet I found some practices useful – practices originating from consulting. I just thought, not everyone worked in consulting, and even if that&#39;s the case, it takes some effort to apply these approaches to the job search. The approaches I&#39;m going to discuss are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypothesis testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a sales funnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices could give you some structure and processes, and the output of these processes would be information or progress – both practically measurable. It&#39;s not a holistic framework in any way, and I will not talk here about any lifehacks or shortcuts, simply because I don&#39;t believe in them. It also leaves some frustrating moments intact: sometimes it&#39;s just a game; you have to play by the rules and you can&#39;t get feedback even if you invested a lot of time and effort applying for some position. I can&#39;t change that, and I don&#39;t believe any online platform with &amp;quot;new rules&amp;quot; could do it either. This text is about concentrating on what you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hypothesis-testing&quot;&gt;Hypothesis testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job market can be untransparent, and that complicates the task of finding a job: is my profession in high demand? What salary can I expect? On the other hand, finding your dream job depends on so many detailed questions – how a particular sentence in your CV or cover letter is perceived, what&#39;s the right order of paragraphs in your cover letter, what impression you should leave your vis-à-vis with after the job interview, and so on. The right answers increase the likelihood of getting a job – so how do you get them when you lack feedback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this task is formalized in market research and product development and is solved with hypothesis testing. The principles are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a written list of hypotheses. Include a description of the expected result indicating whether the hypothesis is true or false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate hypotheses from each other – in other words, follow the principle &amp;quot;other things being equal.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move from the most certain feedback to experiments, because experiments are more expensive, and asking questions is often free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s just the beginning; I highly recommend reading some detailed descriptions of hypothesis testing. I just hope you get the idea – that you are not just &amp;quot;running around like a chicken with its head cut off.&amp;quot; (C) It&#39;s the chaotic yet time-consuming activities that make this experience so awful. Even if I don&#39;t get a job, I&#39;d like to get some information regarding the hypotheses I have. Here are the hypotheses I had and how I tested them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there demand for the job I&#39;m looking for?&lt;/strong&gt; First, identify the keywords to look for, then search for the jobs, then read and try to find out if the job description is reasonable and relevant, and finally call and ask if this job is still available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much money should I ask for?&lt;/strong&gt; External HR agencies are your friends in this case, as they are interested in selling you. The information is more relevant if you&#39;ve had an interview and understand the other variables (company size, responsibility in terms of budget and number of people or projects to manage, location, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impression should I leave?&lt;/strong&gt; Starting from the more direct feedback, you could speak with a familiar HR specialist, if you have one – especially if you apply not in the country of your origin; it&#39;s hard to feel cultural differences sometimes. But from my experience, experiments work best: just change your attitude a little bit and track the feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I change in my CV/cover letter?&lt;/strong&gt; There are too many options and it&#39;s hard to get representative data, so it&#39;s cheaper to ask someone you know. Still, I strongly believe in filtering the feedback, being and expressing yourself – because if you incorporate all the feedback, your CV/cover letter will become too general. We are in marketing here, so you need to differentiate yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve tested all the hypotheses you needed, sometimes it&#39;s just about putting the work into applying for the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-sales-funnel&quot;&gt;Building a sales funnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a sales funnel is a complicated way to say: how do you actually acquire opportunities? First, you have at least a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a useful post on LinkedIn (you could also repost some article or video), as well as keep your profile updated and get noticed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage your connections – family, friends, colleagues – at least inform them that you are looking for a job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to recruiting agencies; if it&#39;s applicable in your country, it&#39;s called an &amp;quot;initiative application&amp;quot; in Germany; they also offer outstaffing opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to a company you like without a particular job – also an &amp;quot;initiative application&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to recent job postings – that&#39;s obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, these options work together: if someone finds you using keywords from your profile, they&#39;ll be more convinced to contact you if you have an updated profile and maybe some recent posts. Recently an interviewer opened my blog during the interview and found some interests in common. It&#39;s called &amp;quot;points of contact&amp;quot; in sales – and I have doubts if it&#39;s directly applicable here, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of job postings, building a sales funnel has a slightly different meaning: it&#39;s about filtering the job postings, so you should write down your filtering criteria before the search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the job posting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keywords to search for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What % of travel is acceptable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research and/or reflection are required to decide what you are actually looking for. What are the most favourable locations for you, where you could relocate easily? What websites have the freshest job postings and which ones are just &amp;quot;repost feeds&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let&#39;s move on to the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-constraints&quot;&gt;Dealing with constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constraints are the itemized answers to the question &amp;quot;why don&#39;t I get a job?&amp;quot; For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m not in the required location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ask for too much in terms of money and benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My language proficiency is insufficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My job experience is not relevant for the positions I&#39;m looking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I face some discrimination issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I do face some discrimination issues – but the question is: are the issues above internal or external? Language proficiency, for example, is internal, as you can fix it yourself. On the other hand, discrimination issues just narrow your job market. I personally decided to live with it; otherwise, it&#39;s about activism – and I&#39;m writing an article about the job search. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a book called &amp;quot;Goldratt&#39;s Theory of Constraints&amp;quot; by H. William Dettmer. The point is that you have a flow, and you have some narrow point which obstructs the flow. So you eliminate the obstacle that constrains the flow the most and then move to the next obstacle. In this case, all the obstacles are considered internal, and the reality is a little bit different. Anyway, asking yourself &amp;quot;What&#39;s my biggest constraint?&amp;quot; is followed by the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I internalize this constraint?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What hypotheses about the existence of this constraint should I have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I test these hypotheses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&#39;s internal, what do I need to fix it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&#39;s external, should I avoid this constraint while building the sales funnel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bonus tip: ask yourself – what constrains others’ trust in me? References, certificates, activity on social networks, and connections actually build trust. If you’re a good fit for the job, it may simply be a trust issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very sensitive questions can be regarded this way – and nobody&#39;s watching. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work with computers, systems, and processes, and I&#39;m convinced that at the end of the day we always have people and communication between them – and that always matters the most. Applying for a job and everything around it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; communication, so when you&#39;re unable to shape a message and convey it in an understandable manner, no framework will save you. But time and resources are limited, so I hope these thoughts regarding communication &lt;strong&gt;priorities&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>7 Sins of Dysfunctional IT Management</title>
    <link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-it-management-sins.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-06T19:03:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2025-10-it-management-sins.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to present some signs of dysfunctional IT management that are easy to recognize. If these signs are present, it means that some major standard IT management practices or processes are missing. These indicators don’t care what your IT director declares or what certifications you hold. Yes, the focus is heavily on information security for a reason – in all the sections below, information security is central. If these practices are missing, you risk losing information in the best-case scenario, or paying for it in the worst case. Many companies do end up paying in such situations but don’t advertise it, so we lack reliable statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to pull some data, but for me the reasoning is simple: you have a hacker in a third world country with a 100 USD computer motivated to get some percent of million-dollar ransom for each case he/she/they was able to encrypt and/or steal/destroy company&#39;s data. And an employer can even not pay the hacker, just feed him, 5 USD a day would be enough. Just look at these differences, and you&#39;ll get the idea about this motivation. And the more the company pays, the more profitable this &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; becomes. But economics is egoistic, some companies pay to learn about information security the hard way, and they are not concerned about the information security of the others, except for the large companies requiring at least something from their suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-no-minimal-itil-practices-implemented&quot;&gt;1. No minimal ITIL practices implemented&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, ITIL is a well-known set of processes and practices for IT Service Management, you normally start with a Service Desk (a single point of contact) and Incident Management, then proceed to Problem Management, Change Management, Configuration Management and so on. Sure, every process costs a lot of money to implement and to keep it running. I usually start checking Service Desk and asking three basic questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a single point of contact exist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone know about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I send a message to this point of contact, will anything happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you end up with a few different points of contact, someone is unaware, or actually nothing happens, you are in trouble. NIS2, an EU regulation, to put it into simple words, just says: bro, just use ITIL. Now NIS2 is a requirement for big companies or companies operating critical infrastructure, and it&#39;s not mandatory for all the businesses – for obvious reasons. But I think literally all the companies should implement minimal ITIL, which is also about some basic security, backups in terms of data and in terms of internet channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have one internet channel and we&#39;re doing fine!&amp;quot; – say some &amp;quot;top-managers&amp;quot;, but that simply means your processes are not automated. By automation I mean something in the information system directs informational and/or material flows in reality. If you enter transactions post-factum, that&#39;s not automation in this sense. There&#39;s a particular very low level of information exchange and efficiency associated with this model, and there&#39;s nothing to be proud about, to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For governments and government suppliers, a high level of ITIL implementation is actually mandatory, and a few recent incidents prove that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security update ruined airport services over the world on 19th 2024 (delivered to you by CrowdStrike and Microsoft) – a typical example of release management not in place, and it&#39;s even not that high-level process. I&#39;m maybe dumb, but I still can&#39;t get how you can run critical apps on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/858tb-of-government-data-may-be-lost-for-good-after-south-korea-data-center-fire/&quot;&gt;Government data lost in South Korea data center yesterday&lt;/a&gt; – well, it&#39;s something more advanced, it&#39;s called Continuity Management and it was widely adopted after 9/11, that you probably shouldn&#39;t have all the data centers and data in one physical location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&#39;s return to any company, no matter how small it is, and talk about basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-using-email-to-send-important-documents&quot;&gt;2. Using email to send important documents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start from the theory, but I&#39;ll try to make it exciting, because it&#39;s not about the email per se, it&#39;s about ignoring the fundamental principles. So information transfer should go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender sends the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The receiver receives the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The receiver sends the confirmation, that the message was received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender receives the confirmation; if confirmation is not received within reasonable time, he tries again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automate it and make it kind of standard, the engineers invented a transaction: before the first action the sender should probably open a transaction and close it when the confirmation is received, otherwise roll the transaction back, so the state is that the message was not received. Transactions guard one of the most important things everyone actually cares about, and it&#39;s called data integrity. People get that you can&#39;t be half-pregnant. But they use email, where transactions do not exist and you do not have idea if the message was received. Ok, technically there are private extensions that allow this confirmation check mark, but it&#39;s not standard and if there&#39;s no check mark it doesn&#39;t tell you anything as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s not the only problem with email! The protocol presumes that there will be a number of servers in the middle, which are almost randomly selected. So, first, a server can get a message and go off-grid, and no one will ever know the message ever existed. But, second, any server in the middle can read your message. I&#39;m in the church of cryptography with the open key, so I believe that it will be significantly harder to read encrypted messages, and I don&#39;t believe in any other &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; measures. But that&#39;s not all. The &amp;quot;guy in the middle&amp;quot; could modify the message and send it further or send other &amp;quot;phishing&amp;quot; messages based on the information he has. Any modern messenger (WhatsApp, Slack, MS Teams) is better than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally have no idea why people still use email for any business-related issue, why all the services in the internet are activated using email. And if you send any business-related document, it&#39;s on you to encrypt it and to (well, manually) get a confirmation that it was received. And from that I see what telecom providers are doing as literally heroic efforts to make this zombie (I mean email) work. They do it using, for example, credibility score for the server, so although technically you can create your own email server, almost no one does it nowadays, because it&#39;s problematic to make it work. So, it&#39;s not &lt;strong&gt;that bad&lt;/strong&gt;, but it&#39;s still bad. The thing that surprises me the most, that I&#39;ve never read a single article like &amp;quot;guys, we should stop using email and solve this email problem, maybe we should all agree on some new protocol&amp;quot;. More companies use chats, because of the speed of information exchange. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy writing structured mails, but in this case chat is better from security and data integrity viewpoints. Ok, let&#39;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-not-using-digital-signature&quot;&gt;3. Not using digital signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can encrypt your email or you could sign it, that&#39;s basically a checksum, verifiable with the help of your publicly-available signature (the open key). But digital signature goes beyond that and in civilized countries the legislation is for a long time in place, so in Europe you can sign any contract with appropriate signature and it will be no different from a contract signed on paper. Why are paper transactions so bad? I read some papers of the Docusign, the market leader, and I saw some arguments, but they seem vague to me, so here&#39;s my version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single source of truth: you trust the information system, what contract version is in place, you don&#39;t waste the time checking it and making suboptimal decisions based on guesses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speed of working with information, because you can use all the digital tools to work with the contracts in the digital form, even basic operations like search, find and replace matter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information security and data integrity: access is managed in the program and you can have all the proper backups for the data on all the continents, if it&#39;s justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s something still missing with digital signatures, at least in Europe. This technology is based on cryptography, I mean the algorithms are freely available to everyone. I know there are costs associated with running call centers for video verifications or cloud solutions to store the data and host the approval processes, integration with external systems, etc. Still, basic digital signature from my perspective should be dirt cheap, and it&#39;s not there. I looked for the solutions and the suppliers, the top-management of the small companies still can&#39;t justify the cost for themselves, especially if we are talking about signing numerous project documents, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&#39;t know what are the limits for disrupting this industry, I mean for a competitor with a dirt-cheap solution to appear. I assume that there are some certification or license costs for signature providers, and it&#39;s like licensing the air, because the technology costs nothing. Nowadays it&#39;s a cringe to set Russia as an example, but just to prove the point that a digital signature can be working and dirt-cheap, that&#39;s what has been achieved in Russia, and I mean country-wide. Actually the size of the territory, dysfunctional post services and an environment with a low trust between the counterparties accelerated this process. So, it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-lamp-wordpress-even-for-external-websites&quot;&gt;4. LAMP/Wordpress, even for external websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the most technical part, and probably the most arguable, but I carefully crafted and collected my arguments for a long time, so let&#39;s dive into it. First, a few words about the heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LAMP stands for Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP. Linux and MySQL are still going strong, from my point of view, but Apache and PHP seem to be irrelevant, more on that below;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Even&amp;quot; for external websites means that although external environment is more dangerous, you&#39;d probably have no serious consequences if it&#39;s hacked, as it contains no critical info or personal data. It&#39;s a &amp;quot;business card&amp;quot; type website with some info about the company, it&#39;s not a web app involved in some business processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues with Apache were noticed and fixed by Ryan Dahl, the Creator of Node.js, and you can read some useful stuff in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-ryan-dahl-creator-nodejs-andrey-okhotnikov/&quot;&gt;interview from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. For me, it comes down to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launching application server, in case of Apache it&#39;s mod_php, to service just one request. One application server for one request, that&#39;s crazy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking, which is discussed in the interview, which is consequence, because mod_php apps can&#39;t really communicate with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mod_php as the prevailing app making php the prevailing language for the back-end, although PHP stands for &amp;quot;PHP hates programmers&amp;quot;. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let&#39;s look at the other side. The technologies evolved just to make Apache usable further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nginx, which was introduced as a caching web-server for static content, generated by mod_php;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;containers for load balancing; well, it&#39;s not that hard to overload Apache, if it launches new app for each request; by the way, it&#39;s called C10k problem, because you need just 10k connections for that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frameworks with caching architecture, like Drupal, again to address this mod_php problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These technologies are the crutches for an outdated technology. The presence of these crutches itself poses a question: maybe we should invent a new solution without these flaws?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m really disappointed with breaking changes in PHP 8, which prevented me to use my favourite Dokuwiki in my next projects, made it harder to install Dokuwiki just to access my old knowledge base and raised security concerns about all the frameworks that didn&#39;t migrate to PHP 8, because PHP 7 will eventually come to the end of life. So, yes, breaking changes really break the trust in the technology. And that&#39;s apart from PHP not encouraging developers to build stable secure apps. On the contrary, it lowered the qualification required to write a web app, so, yes, it&#39;s still powering 80% of the web, an average PHP app being just horrible. Laravel still keeps PHP alive, though. Regretfully, but there&#39;s another problem: there are not so many battery-included frameworks, Laravel being one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress had numerous vulnerabilities, using it means you chose the cheapest solution not taking into consideration anything else. It&#39;s just displaying your IT illiteracy to the whole world. By the way, anyone can view the HTML source and find Wordpress there. It&#39;s just a joke when a corporate website is powered by it. It&#39;s a double joke when it&#39;s hosted on a shared web hosting, these guys can be just scam, making you pay more the next year for doing less – probably because they know that you are not that tech-savvy, if you use their services. That&#39;s the reason I migrated to the static website on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were there days when LAMP and even Wordpress were cool? Sure, like in 90s. Why isn&#39;t it cool anymore? Well, we have other technologies. And by technologies I don&#39;t mean Node.js only, Go is probably better, it looks like a proper Node.js and fixed JavaScript. Of course there are hardships with Go and Node.js, as well as with React and other front-end frameworks. But it&#39;s better to have a modern stack even on a business-card type website. It turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://justfuckingusereact.com/&quot;&gt;React is still cool&lt;/a&gt;, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you want a dynamic business-card website? You could have a static website and still have dynamic forms, even comments and search using external services. But your website would be blazing fast, bullet-proof secure, and nobody prevents you from making it look beautiful. You even could use React/Vue, although it presumes some back-end, and solutions like Docusaurus, Gatsby, Astro, VitePress. Because that&#39;s cool now. N.B.: I use 11ty, by the way, as you can see in the footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-no-regular-pen-testing-from-external-company&quot;&gt;5. No regular pen testing from external company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s return to security, and it&#39;s as good as it gets to break it. So, how do you break security? It turns out, that &amp;quot;psy ops&amp;quot; are more effective, so you&#39;ll probably use phishing emails or calls, even some offline contact with a person to build trust and to make him/her/them break security protocol. To open a link, to fill in the password on a phishing website, to send a confidential document to a hacker. You need not that complicated tech here, and you can&#39;t know how secure you are when you don&#39;t measure. Well, that&#39;s exactly the point to be measured: the end of the chain, the most vulnerable link, a human. Your dear employees passed the trainings, successfully answered all the questions after that. But what will they do, when they lack the time, they are stressed and they have never actually identified a menace or reacted to it properly? Well, they&#39;ll open the link and type in their password, what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And testing your company with internal resources is just a conflict of interest, because you paid for these security trainings, it should mean you&#39;d be safe, right? You tend to see reality as you want it, not how it is, and that&#39;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-no-security-trainings-for-everyone&quot;&gt;6. No security trainings for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there&#39;s a war going on, new measures to break your security systems or trick alarms of your employees are invented every day. But what&#39;s the chance that you face something that no one expected before? It&#39;s not that big. Most disasters happen when someone uses a known tactic and scales it. It could be prevented if you just inform people that this type of attack exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few fresh examples when I was almost tricked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request from a chat app to enter my password for this app, it didn&#39;t look like it&#39;s external.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scam when two guys call: one talks to you and says that you&#39;ll get a confirmation code from the bank, and another calls the bank and asks them to send a confirmation call to you; so yes, you receive a confirmation code from your bank, if you&#39;re not aware, and this lowers your security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge tends to dissolve with time, so it&#39;s boring, but reminding people of the security concerns regularly makes them work, and it&#39;s still cheaper than dealing with the consequences. Ok, let&#39;s talk about the last topic here, when someone steals a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-not-encrypting-laptop-drives&quot;&gt;7. Not encrypting laptop drives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked at an audit company, in the consulting department though, and there was a mandatory training that the price of the laptop is nothing compared to the value of the information on it. I think probably more people should think about it. Sure enough, all the laptop drives were encrypted, and some other security measures were implemented to prevent copying data to non-encrypted USB drives or sending data over the network. From what I know now, that&#39;s not enough, but encrypting the hard drive is the ABC of information security. You even don&#39;t need anyone to steal a laptop; people just forget their laptops everywhere. You just need to apply statistics and probability theory, multiply by the number of employees in your company, and you&#39;ll get the exact number of laptops that will be lost per year for sure. Do I need to say more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t know what will happen, but I believe in processes and practices that can deal at least with what we know about. The real facepalm happens when we knew about the risk, and we didn&#39;t manage it. It&#39;s strange that this type of behaviour is present in IT, but it is, and it&#39;s not always the money, it&#39;s about the literacy, curiosity and staying up-to-date. Well, that&#39;s what makes professionalism, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-started&quot;&gt;How it started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I was reading the reddit /linuxsucks community. After that, I noticed more &#39;migration to Linux&#39; discussions, and I thought: why would no one make a Windows-to-Linux migration toolkit? This raised two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there tasks worth automating?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the program provide some links for novices to “start with Linux the right way”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the latter point, I suppose more people should get acquainted with Linux through Git for Windows and virtual machines. The main mistake is when you don’t understand what you are doing, and you install Linux as a single or dual-boot operating system (backups are for cowards), and then it doesn’t work as expected. That’s called &#39;expectation management&#39;, and probably we never really saw it as a task. The most successful case, Ubuntu, tried to meet existing expectations, making Linux &#39;almost like Windows&#39;, but I don’t think it’s worth it. I use Fedora and suggest more people should try it – but it’s an entirely different animal, and you’d better be prepared for that. And, by the way, the question of choosing a distribution could also be addressed in my program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be automated? I thought of two tasks: backups and saving a report about hardware and software installed, for reference. Both tasks are not &#39;1-click&#39; in Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a backup, you shouldn’t save the &#39;home user directory&#39;. Instead, you should back up individual folders like &#39;Documents&#39;, &#39;Pictures&#39;, etc. But, surprise, folder names are localized in Windows! And if you’re migrating to Linux, you’d better go with a tar or tar.bz2 archive – it just works better for lots of files and folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a hardware report, it’s not that easy to find and save this information. I also decided to include printers and scanners, since they cause plenty of compatibility issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ikostas/lmtk&quot;&gt;&#39;one-time-use app&#39;&lt;/a&gt;, I went with Python + Tkinter. Python is great for its libraries: getting hardware/software info, creating backups, generating Markdown reports, converting Markdown to HTML, and so on. Tkinter is an integrated GUI toolkit—outdated, sure, but fast, small, and stable. The resulting program was about 17 MB. Then I decided to localize it to German, and Python made that pretty easy. Later, I ran pylint and found so many errors – I honestly don’t know how it worked at all. But I had fun programming it, thinking about class structure and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-s-going-a-new-challenge&quot;&gt;How it’s going: a new challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next fun project, I decided to create a GUI app for Linux. The idea was to manipulate PDF files, but also to build a chain of commands: extract pages 3–4 from one file, unite them with pages 1–2 from another, and so on. I personally use the CLI for these tasks, the only problem I have is forgetting the CLI parameters. So I thought: wouldn’t it be nice if I could save this chain of commands and reuse it? Nothing you can’t do with a bash script, though. :) Anyway, here are my requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GUI should be nice and fast – and this excludes Python. Not only is it slow and single-threaded, I ran into some rough edges with the &#39;threads&#39; package when I tried to make the UI responsive. Still, Python gets credit for having great GTK4 bindings and PDF manipulation libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not a programmer. I know Python, JS, and I took a course in Go at Codecademy (free, by the way). I didn’t like GJS; Go seemed like a reasonable choice. Goroutines allow threading, which makes the UI responsive, and the &#39;errors-first&#39; approach in Go makes handling user input nice. Yes, I know about Vala, I saw the tutorial, but I doubt I have the programming skills required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program itself should look like three vertically stacked parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files&lt;/strong&gt;: add and remove files; results of operations (e.g. splitting or uniting PDFs) also show up here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operations&lt;/strong&gt;: a chain of manipulations in a human-readable form; users should be able to add/remove operations and (in the distant future) change their order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add an operation&lt;/strong&gt;: choose an operation type, which changes the number of input fields. For split, I need the pages and an output filename; for unite, I need the files and output filename; and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This UI implies lots of changes on the fly: I need to redraw parts of the UI, but I also need to handle faulty situations. For example, you can’t use a file if it’s only created in the next step. There’s a long list of &#39;what can’t be done&#39; and &#39;what to do if a filename or operation is removed&#39;, so this error-handling logic will be a significant part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-rabbit-hole&quot;&gt;A rabbit hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the &#39;rabbit hole&#39; thing began: choosing a GUI library. I chaotically researched everything below, had chatbots write examples to see if I could handle them, and I hope my findings will be useful to someone. I’ll rate GUI libraries from simplest to most complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/&quot;&gt;Zenity&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool. You can use it with any language or even a bash script, but you’re not supposed to redraw parts of the UI – it’s like launching a single program. But it has a file-open dialog, and it can return multiple files. When I tried Fyne (which doesn’t allow selecting multiple files), I had to use Zenity as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/tk9.0&quot;&gt;Tk&lt;/a&gt;: sounds stupid because it’s old as hell, but it works. It has a new version (9), a new &#39;azure&#39; theme, and new Go bindings. So, if it’s stupid but it works – then it’s not stupid (C). It’s fast, works on Linux, Mac, and Windows (a bonus since Go also works cross-platform), it’s surprisingly stable, and it’s rich in widgets. I mean, if your grandpa could get away with these widgets, so can you. It requires simulating HTML, but I don’t need that for this app. So I stuck with Tk9.0 for now. I even considered writing my app in Tcl – it has procedures, loops, and ifs – but it’s too primitive. Go is nicer with structs, interfaces, goroutines, and all that. And surprise! Tk supports selecting multiple files in a file-open dialog. I felt like the Tk guys were my brothers: they think about functionality first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fyne.io/started/&quot;&gt;Fyne&lt;/a&gt; is the recommended Go GUI library, and it’s great. But I tried to write a single operation (extracting pages from a PDF), and Fyne implied using channels just to keep the UI responsive. That felt like overkill. I cried and vented to a chatbot, and it agreed: in this case, Fyne is probably too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4&quot;&gt;GTK4 bindings&lt;/a&gt; exist for Go. The funny part is that you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.gnome.org/jpu/cambalache&quot;&gt;Cambalache&lt;/a&gt; (a RAD tool) and call it from your Go logic. It’s a bit like the next, more &#39;cutting-edge&#39; approach: treating your GTK4 spec as a front-end. I couldn’t figure out why I should use these widgets, and GTK4 only works on Linux. I also doubted whether I’d be able to manipulate the UI easily by adding/removing data. Honestly, I miss React here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wails.io/&quot;&gt;Wails&lt;/a&gt; (for Go) is a great approach: you use JS (probably React) for the front-end. It’s like &lt;a href=&quot;https://v2.tauri.app/&quot;&gt;Tauri&lt;/a&gt; for Rust or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; for JS, with the same drawback: the output is always heavy (20 MB minimum). Yes, I considered Rust (Tauri’s footprint is a bit smaller), but my programming skills aren’t there. If your app is big and complicated anyway, this might be the way to go. React is awesome for declaring UIs and handling user input – I liked it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now you’re ready to look at my work in progress, which I spent about a week building, covered in blood and tears (needed some drama here): a Go app with Tk9.0 and the azure theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/RuinuRqTxP-825.avif 825w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/RuinuRqTxP-825.webp 825w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://en.kovchinnikov.info/img/RuinuRqTxP-825.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add file&quot; width=&quot;825&quot; height=&quot;313&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we need more high-quality GUI apps like this one. :) That’s all for today, folks – hope you enjoyed the ride! :)&lt;/p&gt;
