&lt;p&gt;I've been living with a tight budget for 6 months. From a point when everything seemed 'awful', I came to the point when it's at least 'manageable', and I'd like to share these points with you. There are some limitations though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live alone and I have to consider my preferences only, forcing someone else to follow the same points is useless;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from a tight budget, I have a small apartment, and my other goal is to avoid clutter; before that, I had a big apartment with lots of clutter and I'm even happy that I left that behind;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics like making a creative budget that fits your needs, having the discipline to follow it, or finding ways to gain more money are obviously outside of this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, what do we have here then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying multi-purpose stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter the demand even more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set clear requirements for what you want/need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a list of needs/wants and prioritizing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating healthy food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying used stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postpone costly upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy on the internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through this list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Having a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having a budget I mean creating a budget on paper or in a spreadsheet and sticking to it, otherwise, it's just a paper or a spreadsheet. In a budget you typically have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income entries with the dates + possible deviations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost entries, that's what you &lt;strong&gt;must pay&lt;/strong&gt; within the dates + possible deviations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reserve entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to create a budget is to take &lt;strong&gt;the next month&lt;/strong&gt;, which means all your income was in the previous month. After that you subtract all the cost entries, again, that's what you must pay, like the rent, utility payments, internet, cellular, food, &lt;strong&gt;and your reserve&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., if you get paid late) you get the available sum. It doesn't mean that you are free to spend it, we'll come to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case, I'd like to underline, that all regular payments should be in cost entries, including all the subscriptions. These sums will be written off automatically, so if a subscription is active, it should be there. Sometimes it's hard to remember all the regular spending, so take your time and check two or three times. If you mess up here, you can end up with a really big problem of having a cash gap. By the way, you can go through your bank statement for the previous month, it's legal and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you have a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I expect any required but unregular payments this month? Include them in the costs as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I have needs, that can't be postponed? Like buying shoes or clothes or anything just to keep my normal activities running. Include these costs as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I have any kind of uncertainty? If yes, increase your reserve entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard when the sum you get is next to zero or negative. At least, you know the reality, but, again, sometimes it's really hard to face it. I guess that more people avoid budgeting because of the fear of facing a reality, not because they don't know how to add and subtract &amp;ndash; and that's all required at this stage! If the sum you get is next to zero or negative, you are in the shithole. Getting out of the shithole is hard and there's no receipt to do that. But there's exactly one thing significantly worse than this experience of getting out: being in the shithole and being unaware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying multi-purpose stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I live in a small apartment, I'm concerned about buying stuff. Stuff occupies my personal space and makes my life worse no matter how useful it is. That's how I live, and I don't expect you to agree with that, as well as with the whole minimalist philosophy. Although I can't admit I follow this philosophy all the time. I just tried to explain the choices I make from the examples below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hack came from a video about hiking. Just imagine you carry for several days the stuff you buy. Is a coffee machine worth it? I'm not a coffee fan, but I like to drink coffee sometimes, and my guests do too. I like brewing tea and I don't like teabags. How's that related to each other? Well, a French press allows me to have reasonably good coffee and brew tea in it. A French press is simple to wash, and it occupies a fraction of the space for a teapot and a coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for tools. First, any multitool is great in terms of space occupied. Any wrench with variable head size is better than a set of fixed-sized wrenches. But my most beloved example is a drill: you can have a corded drill or a cordless drill that would replace an electric screwdriver, a drill, and a perforator... if it's good enough! In some cases, the perforator can't be replaced, but it can be borrowed to accomplish a particular work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I just don't care about having a multi-purpose table: it's a dining table, a writing table, and a computer table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all, let's talk about storage. In a small apartment, I needed a cheap solution for storing tools, clothes, and some other stuff, including a vacuum cleaner and a set of bicycle tires, for example. A few shelves? Too much for me. So I bought the biggest shelving unit that could fit into one of the niches, and now I store everything there. It's cheap, it's divided by the levels, I have shoes under the shelves and plenty of space left to store something else. The design or the color? I don't care. It looks great to me because it solves so many problems. And I have a living room completely free of all that stuff at once, it's just magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filter the demand even more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think you need to buy something and you think you have a budget for that. If you don't buy it, you make some money ('A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned' &amp;copy;). So, it makes sense to invest some effort and ask yourself a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would I do with it right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I do the same with something else I already have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I throw away after buying it (especially when the item replaces something)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where will I store it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will using it make me happy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions can help you not only avoid buying unnecessary stuff but also can make you buy it later. And future costs are discounted! And I would emphasize using vs. owning because lots of 'lifestyle' gear fall in this category. And yes, you'll never use that 'EDC gear', so don't buy it 'just in case'. You'll manage to get out of any situation with what you have, that's what brains are for. And yes, it may involve some trauma not owing 'some cool EDC gear', but we're on a tight budget, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set clear requirements for what you want/need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of 'high-quality stuff', and in many cases, I don't see the difference. If you do so, there's a good buying method called 'technically acceptable/best price'. You need to have some requirements (what is acceptable), and then you buy the item that is the cheapest and fits the requirements. You are welcome to make some market research first to justify your requirements first. But once the requirements are set, you just buy the cheapest option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus you avoid 'maverick buying'. For example, I want a sandwich maker. I come to the shop and see a sandwich maker for 13 &amp;euro; and... 3-in-1: a waffle maker, a sandwich maker and a grill, which costs 25 &amp;euro;. Maybe it's nice to have 3-in-1, but my requirements were a sandwich maker, so I buy it and save 12 &amp;euro;. These 'optimizing thoughts' right before you buy are great, but they will not allow you to cut the costs. If you have a need, you'd know it when you shape the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, sellers often see when you are not sure and use it. Then if you are going to buy a knife you come home with a food processor. Will it make you happy? Perhaps sometime in the future. Will it cut the costs now? Probably not, if &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt; you need just a knife. By the way, a kitchen knife can substitute a lot of stuff (see 'Buying multi-purpose stuff' above), if you know how to use it. If you have access to YouTube, you can learn that for free, just a few fingers cut off... :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Having a list of needs/wants and prioritizing it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked the question 'Will using it make me happy?', I didn't want to overcomplicate things right away. But the actual question is 'Will it make me happy than buying anything else?'. It's hard to do this mental exercise for every item, and at the same time if you don't buy something you need to get some satisfaction in exchange, otherwise you just get depressed that you can't afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that even if you have a lot of money buying everything at once can put you in the shithole immediately. So, buying everything you want at once is just silly. Getting frustrated about it is silly as well, but quite natural. When we create a 'wish list', we 'do' something about it. And after that, some magic can happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can decide something different fitting the same need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can decide that you no longer have that need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone can ask you: 'What do you want for a birthday?', and you'll have an answer to that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't go crazy about my wish lists, they are not very long and they are not prioritized in a spreadsheet. Some items there are just to remember some ideas, which could be useful. And sometimes I tend to delete most of the items from the list. But when I decide to buy something, I look quickly through my wish lists and ask myself: 'Didn't I miss something important?' Choosing can be difficult, and a list makes it a bit easier, so it's better to have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eating healthy food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure that this idea will help anyone, because with food it works differently: sometimes you want to eat something for stress relief, or because you like the taste of it. By no means I'm going to encourage anyone to save on food for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, just knowing some facts can help you save without sacrificing anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt; eating at home is cheaper and healthier, than in cafes/restaurants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking at home is cheaper and healthier, than buying semifinished, pre-made food or 'ready to consume' junk food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning your weekly menu can help you eat more balanced food and get better use of the products you buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it stop you the next time you'd like to buy some junk food? No, just go ahead and buy it. It works differently: when knowing this will make you write a shopping list without junk food with a feeling like you're not sacrificing anything, then it works. You'll probably change your mind in the shop, sellers of junk food are good at marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying used stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifespan of lots of things is more, than two years. Especially for industries, where everything changes not so fast. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicycles. You can get a bike 2x cheaper for a 2-3 year bike, which will be almost like new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electric appliances. You can even buy a cordless drill with dead batteries. And change the batteries, including non-original options. If it's still cheaper to buy a used one (including the cost for the batteries), there's just no reason to buy a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars and motorcycles &amp;ndash; this can be tricky with hidden defects, but you can cope with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example when that's not applicable is printers. First, the new models are better and they do cost not so much. Second, HP has an 'Instant Ink' program, which is for new printers only. And ink cost is a lot more than the cost of the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Postpone costly upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices like laptops, tablet PCs, and mobile phones cost a lot. There are some options to buy refurbished ones, but still, they cost a lot of money. If they still work and you are on a tight budget, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; they are not critical for earning money, I'd suggest postponing the upgrade. You can hope that this 'tight budget' period will end and after that, you'll be able to upgrade. Meanwhile, their price always drops as new models come out, so it makes sense to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buy on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're on a tight budget, you're not going to buy low-quality staff, and reviews on the websites give you some confidence. When I read those reviews, I understand that I can't imagine all the situations when something doesn't fit my requirements or accidentally breaks down. So reviews are great, and it's better to have some of them, but for the local shops (especially selling private labels stuff) that's not achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'd not go crazy ordering everything on the internet. Sometimes I just feel that on the internet I could have something that fits my needs better. It may be cheaper, it may be more expensive, but I need to be sure. For lots of items, my requirements are not that complicated and then I can buy it in a local shop when they have that item. Delivery also is costly, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But delivery is great when they deliver a 15 kg package of dog food to your door. No way I'd be carrying that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summing up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you found some tips useful for you, please let me know in the comments. Saving for me is not a sacrifice with these tips, it's about being happier with the stuff I buy. And I also hope that it works the same way for you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Commuting on a bike: adventures begin</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2023-03-commuting2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-25T22:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-25T22:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2023-03-25:/2023-03-commuting2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cycling stopped being smooth and cheap&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, here's a link to &lt;a href="2023-02-commuting.html"&gt;part 1 of my commuting experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's too boring to write about cycling as a cheap, effortless, and effective hobby, let's count the bucks. It all started when my rear tire ended unexpectedly. I managed to borrow 'a grandpa's bike' from my friend for free till the new tire arrived in three days, but for the few past weeks there were some costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, the tire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one day I bought a ticket to the train&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dog destroyed my pants and my windbreaker, which was only 15 years old, so I had to buy a new stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new tire required pressure of 6-8 bar, I managed to make 6 and damaged my pump, so I had to buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B094TXY2CD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;amp;th=1"&gt;a new one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00VGEF18A?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details"&gt;a front rack&lt;/a&gt; for my backpack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep my back clean, I had to buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BD254L15?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details"&gt;a mudguard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought grease for the bearings and a degreaser to wash the bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also bought a chain cleaning kit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my new pants fell off, I bought a belt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain grease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it's not cheap &amp;ndash; and all that in less than a month! The truth is that you have to keep a lot of tools just to keep your bike rolling. I didn't expect that, but it was too late to surrender... The service doesn't work in the evening, it's expensive and the next day I have to go, but I don't like the train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fitting the stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fit the front rack I had to disassemble my front brake partially, but even after that, the handlebar is not turning well. That's the price of being stylish and not liking the back pannier rack. My backpack fits the rack only when the backpack is flat. Life is a pain, and I try to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mudguard was designed to fit only on bikes with disk brakes, and that's not my case. I managed to fit it from the inside of the frame, and it works great with a weight of only 20 grams. I don't get any mud from the front wheel and I get only minor mud on the lower part of my pants from my rear wheel now, so now they let me go to decent places after the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a back jacket with a tight fit, and it's so much better than the windbreaker. For the pants, my demands are quite high, because I don't like lycra and I'd like to have a tight fit, a civil look, and a durable material. I've seen slim-fit jeans on some BMX riders and I had some doubts, but they worked great. These jeans are stretchy and they don't touch the chain. Maybe I attract some more attention &amp;ndash; I don't know as there are mostly old ladies in my town. And I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surpise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, you can get compensation for riding a bike, so I got 132 &amp;euro; for riding 600&amp;nbsp;km per month. Why's that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get healthy, and that's important here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to buy some stuff for the bike (please see the list above), and for electric bikes, the costs are higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cars are compensated as 0.2 &amp;euro; per km, and as Germany supports clean transport, maybe that would be strange to pay less for riding the bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this amount of money, you can get a (very nice) used bike every month, but nobody would ride 30&amp;nbsp;km every day on such a bike. How does it feel? Well, not so nice, especially because of the saddle. I rode a 'grandpa's bike' which I borrowed for three days, so I put the saddle high and my arms as low as possible. It took me 1 hour to ride the same distance, which took 40-45 minutes on my bike (50 minutes in relaxed mode). And I was so happy to get my bike back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disassembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few showers of rain, I felt that there was no grease in the bearings inside the hubs, so I decided to disassemble them. It took me 3 hours to wash the bike, wash the chain twice (as it was too dirty), disassemble the hubs, grease the hubs, grease the chain, and after all that clean my flat of all the mess. By the way, I had some more things to do that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found several issues during the disassembly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chain was in a bad condition, it was stretched and twisted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rear hub was damaged because of my riding style, there were clear impact marks from the bearings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll talk a bit about the root causes for that below, but I'd like to outline two points here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the rain, my bike is covered with sand, maybe because I'm near the sea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper chain grease makes a huge difference under the rain, as a cheap one gets washed out during the first 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that might sound sad, but after the assembly, the bike runs surprisingly well, smoothly, and effortlessly. Especially without the wind of 95&amp;nbsp;km/h. I think it will die soon though, just because it's a singlespeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, but what does it take to ride a bike 30&amp;nbsp;km per day? From my viewpoint it's all about consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning and greasing the bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretching and massaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad scenario looks like this: you forget to check the bike, get late to sleep, have no time to stretch and eat in the morning, and at the end, you struggle, although this 30&amp;nbsp;km ride can be quite enjoyable. The bike works well in a narrow range of setups, and so does the body, if you want optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wipe the chain every day because otherwise, the chain gets greasy, then the sand sticks to it and the sand destroys the chain very quickly. Now I started to see the point in kevlar belts instead of the chain. And I also try to get a healthy breakfast every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is signlespeed good for commuting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with the bike though? I think, a singlespeed is just not designed to fit commuting of my type and my riding style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The winds make me push the chain harder, as I don't have a lower gear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tire pressure and a rough city terrain hit the hub, and it also makes riding uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm going to change the bike. See you in the next part, where I'll share some findings from exploring the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="cycling"></category></entry><entry><title>Use cases for opensource apps in business</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2023-03-opensourceusecases.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-22T17:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-22T17:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2023-03-22:/2023-03-opensourceusecases.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several examples of opensource apps in a corporate environment&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some opensource apps are old, and with rapid technology development, we all hoped that some new great apps would evolve. But the reality is that the 'good old apps' I used more than 8 years ago are still here, and they are still a reasonable choice for several tasks. The key to implementing a business app in a corporate environment, from my viewpoint, is not in the app itself, but in the business process around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in this article I'll cover two 'apps of choice' for me, which I used several times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki"&gt;Dokuwiki&lt;/a&gt;, a wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mantisbt.org/"&gt;Mantis&lt;/a&gt;, a bug tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are both written in PHP (oh, my...), but they are both still alive. So, the use cases for these apps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A knowledge database using a wiki,  I had 3 of these&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A task management system using a bug tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A claims management system using a bug tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A knowledge base using wiki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements are quite simple: make knowledge inside a consulting company available to the staff, because when you stop 'reinventing the wheel' on every project it costs less and involves fewer risks. I saw a knowledge database that failed because of access issues. If you want maximum leverage of the knowledge, you have to make it a priority to maximize the usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the knowledge accessible to everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easy to contribute for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes a complicated issue in a big company, and I didn't have this problem in my case. If you are restricting access, I'd consider two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this information so valuable and easily applicable to other companies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone wants to steal this information, are there easier ways to do that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that was a preface, the real work starts with building the business processes around the knowledge base. What are they? I prefer to keep things simple, so I start with the two processes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input, or collecting the knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output, or using the knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if you want to maximize the leverage of the work accomplished (and the knowledge you have), then 'can' turns into 'should': we should connect the knowledge from particular phases and we should use it first when we are looking for the solution on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could have separate processes for that, but the easiest way is to get current processes and instead include this Input and Output as procedures in particular places. Thus it's a change and it requires less effort to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's different about these 'knowledge database-related' processes and procedures is that people get excited about collecting useful knowledge for the team. So making a 'top contributors' list is a good idea to encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A task management system using a bug tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every organization has a kind of workflow and task management tasks that fall outside the scope of specific systems like ERP (enterprise resource management systems). Now we have BPM (business process management) systems, that allow us to construct almost any kind of process, and further automate some of the functions inside the process. The question is: can this be simplified? I tried to simplify this, and it worked, and the main idea is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we say that we won't construct a process out of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; fantasies, but instead use &lt;strong&gt;a template&lt;/strong&gt;: someone starts an action, it should be approved, assigned, executed, and controlled. It could be different, but it &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be something similar. And we could have several templates, but let's just get the idea with one. It works as simple as that for 90-95% of cases, then why should you pay more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can fit the majority of your processes, then... welcome to the world of bug trackers! You do not need a BPMN system, you could have issues, issue statuses, and comments (with some attachments), which is dead simple and deadly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What modifications of the bug tracker are required for that? Well, none, as the names of the statuses can be changed. What you need to do is to agree on the status sequence and develop a business process model to use these statuses. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone raises (creates) an issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some boss approves the execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issue is assigned (or picked up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an executor reports that the issue is done, the issue can be closed OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issue is checked by someone else and closed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantis is one of the simplest systems. What's important: first, it's stable and it works and, second, it allows to have a kind of forum/discussion for each issue with file attachments. This history of issue execution was vitally important for the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A claims management system using a bug tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A claims management system has several differences from the workflow described above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's initiated by the customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers and client managers are usually not very specific about the issue, i.e. they do not provide enough information at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue execution (an investigation) usually gets stuck at some point and needs a push from someone, but the bosses are too busy, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an issue number and an SLA (Service Level Agreement) regarding issue resolution are highly valued by the clients. The first is provided by any bug tracker. What I like about Mantis, is that it has an overview with the 'latest activity' timestamp, so the SLA can be controlled and an issue can be escalated. But we have several questions still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who should ensure that the issue is described fully enough to start the execution? Otherwise, the system and the process will be overwhelmed with issues missing some important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who will ensure, that issues do not get stuck? And, by the way, those issues are closed, which also cleans the list of issues for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's simple: you need someone for that. We called that person 'a claims engineer' and she wasn't subordinate to anyone participating in the process. She could reply 'you need to provide more information' to the client's managers and she could escalate issues, that were stuck. And it just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems a bit more complicated process, but the fact is that even Mantis allowed us to implement this process without any modifications, just using the statuses. But with a business process model, a procedure description and a proper training for everyone involved, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a few ideas to develop this further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could conduct a periodical analysis to enhance the processes, that lead to claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could investigate, who was in charge of the consequences and provide feedback for that person (sorry for the 'managerial' language here, I hope you got the idea)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the tech side, we could download the statistics from the Mantis database, build some reporting, and make some conclusions. The structure of the database allows you to do that, because... it's dead simple as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the lean approach, and the simplest solutions work cost-effectively. What I love about bug tracker systems, is that they got through a long evolution, and they are feature-rich, stable, scalable, and nice to work with. At first, they can be a bit awkward to use for 'business' people (yes, the 'managers'), but no one could ever raise any particular issue about that. An old-fashioned interface? Well, it works. Not too much AJAX? Fortunately, 'business' people don't know these words. Everyone was quite happy about those systems and I hope they are still in place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="opensource"></category></entry><entry><title>Spending a Christmas eve installing Linux on an old laptop</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2023-03-linuxlaptop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-12T12:17:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-12T12:17:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2023-03-12:/2023-03-linuxlaptop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is an old laptop any good for Linux and working&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Spoiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before Christmas (here in Germany it's Catholic) I found an old Laptop under the rain. Someone was moving, and some good stuff was on the ground for a day. I searched a little and found a power supply. At home this laptop revealed that it's fully functional Fujutu Amilo La1703:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Gb RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMD Sepron 1 GHz, single-core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 Gb HDD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Win Vista pro with German interface, not activated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, right? Well, for my childhood that was great and you could do just anything with it. But how do we judge devices now? Wi-Fi should work and it should play YouTube. Well, I didn't get that and gave this laptop to my friend to install some old Windows version. Why's that? Well, everything working and not working is described on &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/FujitsuAmiloLa1703"&gt;this Ubuntu page&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn't get any better. The device is so old, that some links from this page don't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was interesting though because I tried different distributions and they performed surprisingly for me. Some were surprisingly good, some were surprisingly bad. As I'm not religious and Win10 has relatively modest system requirements, I tried to install it as well (several times). If you want to learn about this process and some unexpected outcomes, that's what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linux distributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, you have 64 and 32-bit options, but not for all the distributions. This laptop supports 64-bit, but as it has 2Gb&amp;nbsp;RAM, a 32-bit distro could fit well. Unfortunately, Fedora (one of my favorites) and Ubuntu don't support 32-bit anymore, so I had to try the 64-bit versions. So, I tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debian 32-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest was to make this device work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding graphics, it worked in Debian, but with the wrong resolution. Installing openchrome drivers helped a lot, but I didn't get performance to play YouTube without tearing the video even on the lowest resolution. Fedora installed openchrome at once with the right resolution &amp;ndash; great job! Ubuntu couldn't launch X, I played with X11 config a bit &amp;ndash; but no luck here even with the openchrome installed. So I didn't move further with Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi is supported on this device on Linux only via ndiswrapper. This means that you find Windows drivers and compile a kernel module to use it. This device has 32-bit and 64-bit Windows drivers, but only 32-bit drivers are supported by ndiswrapper. As Fedora is 64-bit only, I get a "Bad magic" error, when I try to use 32-bit drivers on a 64-bit system. And that's the best result so far, as in Debian I couldn't install ndiswrapper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No drama connecting to the Internet here, as this laptop is relatively heavy and large, and the battery is dead, it can be used more as a "movable" laptop (like switching off and moving to another location), than as a "portable" or "mobile". And it has an Ethernet port, so I could connect it to my router. By the way, no drivers were required for Ethernet in any distro. If you need a workaround, you could get a Wi-Fi dongle in this case, one Linux supported. They are relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so how's about sound? Well, it worked exactly as described: very silent and only using the headphones. In Linux you can "overamplify", but the sound quality suffers. The pleasant surprise here is that it worked without any effort with PulseAudio. I installed some ALSA tools, but it didn't change anything. OSS drivers (a relic sound system) support this device, but the drivers are so old &amp;ndash; I didn't find a way to install them on any system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, we have Ethernet, and we have some video drivers (without acceleration, by the way). So, what about YouTube? Well, it plays with a tearing. By the way, as Fedora is 64-bit I could install Google Chrome on that and expect a better experience with Google and YouTube sites. On Debian, I could use Chromium. Nevertheless, YouTube is unusable in any distro or browser. Maybe digging a bit more into video acceleration could fix this, but openchrome drivers are not developed and the website with VIA Linux video drivers is not here anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install LXDE and have a nice desktop experience though. And with Fedora Google Chrome works fine, as well as any other 64 bit modern apps. Ok, let's move on to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Win10 installation experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this laptop passes Win10 requirements and I had quite a positive recent experience installing Win10 on a 10-year-old laptop, I decided to give Win10 a try. To optimize performance you could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off everything affecting performance, except for fonts anti-aliasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use some &lt;a href="https://christitus.com/debloat-windows-10-2020/"&gt;debloating software&lt;/a&gt; to make it even quicker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvi1cF9Nqfk"&gt;some Win10 installation image yourself&lt;/a&gt;, as I don't trust unofficial distributions &amp;ndash; but it's time-consuming and you'll need another Windows machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it start the installation? Well, yes, using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ilMAAk1Q8"&gt;one workaround&lt;/a&gt;. Did it install? No, I was stuck with the "Just a moment" screen, and some "out of the box experience" (OOBE) errors. I tried different ways: booting into the safe mode, disabling some settings in the registry, and it didn't work. The fun fact though is that Windows struggled with the same wrong resolution issue, which was not present in Fedora. And Windows needed drivers, which were available on the Fujitsu website (great!). But OOBE didn't allow me to finish the installation, so I surrendered after a few attempts. OOBE was quite frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to make this laptop work was an adventure for me and I learned a lot. More than that, I felt a kind of nostalgia for playing with it. I started playing with FreeBSD in 1999. Wait... I could try installing FreeBSD on this Fujitsu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, what can you do with it now if it doesn't play YouTube? I don't think working with Google Docs would be a pleasant experience, but on a PC like this or even worse I could type my diploma study and have a PDF using LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a pity we judge devices by YouTube playing, but that's it. I think it's great that YouTube now possesses lots of free educational resources, so I agree that it's an important use case for entertainment and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This laptop could be something like a "typewriter" for someone interested in writing articles (for publishing in PDF or a blog) and... maybe interested in retro-gaming. That's the frontier for this laptop. But the 1 GHz processor... Man, that was fast... At least 15 years ago...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it's not that bad! If you have some more fast computers, you could have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A remote terminal, using X (native), or other servers like X2Go or FreeNX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A TFTP client, which doesn't use HDD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combination of the two above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a "happy hacking" experience for sure... Something I miss with everything around "just working" nowadays, ha-ha!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>What commuting on a bike feels like</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2023-02-commuting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-22T20:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-02-22T20:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2023-02-22:/2023-02-commuting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience cycling for 3 weeks&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm living in Esens (Northern Saxony in Germany) and studying in Wittmund. I chose to commute by bicycle, every day during a working week. Here's my route:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My route" src="images/commuting_route.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That involved significant changes in my life, so in this article, I'm going to cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; is it feasible to get from point A to point B on a bike in a predictable time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; does it matter so much?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence to the body&lt;/strong&gt; what happens to you if you commute 30 km a day for 3 weeks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could choose a train, at a first glance the time is almost the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 minutes on the train (walk 15 minutes, then 15 minutes on the train, then walk 15-20 minutes again)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40-50 minutes or 1 hour on a bike;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few concerns though regarding the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the way back the train departs at 12:40, and I finish studying at 12, so at that time I could be at home already if I take a bike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The winds influence the time, my negative record is 2 hours, and I felt exhausted after that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is not a concern for me, because if I take a train, I get compensated. The costs for bike maintenance are little. I was afraid of mechanical issues with the bike, none of them for 3 weeks though. Just clean and lube the chain, and pump the tires before the rides every week or so. A bonus number 1 is that you're not tied to the train's schedule, if you have to do anything in Wittmund it's not a problem, and you can leave any time on the bike. A bonus number 2 is that on the bike you can do more in Wittmund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking and taking a train is a bit depressing for me, while on the bike the landscape is always different: the fog, the sunrise, etc. The ride depends on you and you are interacting with the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question all the cyclists get is: is the rain so important? Well, for three weeks I was under the rain once, but it was an ice rain. I could just wait for half an hour or an hour, but I decided to ride. It was cold, but I knew I could tolerate that for 1 hour. I got home, took a warm bath, and... nothing happened. The trick here is that it rains, but not the time I ride. Usually, it rains at night and that's fine for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the winds are important. Now I have a singlespeed, so I can't switch the gear down. Sometimes I return fully exhausted after fighting with the wind. But the direction of the wind matters. Winds can be up to 95 km per hour, but strong winds blow only from the North. My destination is in the South, so I always come to my destination on time. On the way back I'm not in a hurry, I can walk. But the wind matters only in open spaces. For the whole distance, I have two such spaces about 800 m each. I see this as a challenge, and if you can tolerate the wind, you can tolerate a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't cold, the lowest temperature is -2&amp;#8451;. Usually, it's above 0, so I put on my thermal T-shirt with a long sleeve and a windbreaker. At first, it's not comfortable, but then I warm up. When it's cold, I add a pullover and that's all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/study-finds-one-habit-can-significantly-lower-your-odds-of-getting-sick-from-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-variants-exercise-illness-infection-diseases-virus-doctors-hospital-health"&gt;study suggests&lt;/a&gt; that exercises can significantly lower your odds of getting sick from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next is that when I ride in the morning, I awaken and get ready for intensive study. But in the long term, it's also energizing and raising the mood. More than that, it helps me to overcome other hard challenges. For example, I'm looking for a job now, and this involves writing a lot of cover letters and getting refused. That really can make anyone feel upset, so cycling helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What nobody is saying about cycling is that when you stop you're feeling cold. At first, you feel hot, but then the body starts to cool down until you feel really cold if you don't dress up or grab a hot drink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body adopts if you cycle regularly and dress up properly: it almost stops sweating. I get a sweat on my back because I'm riding with a backpack. And a rack to hold this backpack is the next upgrade I'm going to make. Shoulders feel also uncomfortable because of that. Regarding muscles, especially those heavily involved in cycling, stretching and massage roller are your best friends and then you get no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third week, I started to feel hungry. Like I'm eating my usual lunch and after that, I'm still hungry. It's normal, as I burn more calories. It's also better to eat more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it worth trying? Sure! Is it accurate in terms of time? Well, it depends, and sometimes it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not giving any advice here, just sharing some of my own experiences. Lots of advice from YouTube helped me though, including bike ergonomics, and eating (before/after/while cycling), but one piece of advice was outstanding. It was from a guy riding hundreds of kilometers. His video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7a5fQk2yvA"&gt;The Most Important Factor for Long Distance Rides/AUDAXs&lt;/a&gt; is great. And the advice is really simple: don't concentrate on the distance or on the time, just enjoy riding!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="cycling"></category></entry><entry><title>Choosing a web hosting at the end of 2022</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2023-02-hosting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-19T19:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-02-19T19:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2023-02-19:/2023-02-hosting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Web hosting adventures and analysis&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hosted my projects at Dreamhost (and I'll not provide the link on purpose), so I was quite happy with the service and paid 100-120 USD yearly, which included two domains and shared web hosting. But then I encountered this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My current hosting plan" src="images/hosting-old.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why's that? Why do I have to pay 156 USD for the same service? It's not about inflation, for sure. Well, the answer was on the front page of the same hosting provider &amp;ndash; hosting plans for the new customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New hosting plan offerings" src="images/hosting-new.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, new customers pay 36 USD for the same service and they can do it monthly! Who's paying for that? Old loyal customers like me! And it's the same for the other providers, so I had to find a &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I found the following alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static hostings at &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, you also need domain hosting to park your domains somewhere and point to your actual hosting, and Cloudflare or Google Domains offer this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's first look at the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some sites requiring PHP and SQL databases, but I doubted whether I needed these sites. Ok, what would happen if I stop them? How many people were using them? The answers were "nothing" and "two" accordingly, so I decided to back up one website and send the backup to another user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, static websites were quite sufficient for my needs, but is that all about requirements? Well, I got used to updating my websites using git, so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can host dynamic and static websites using cloud services. The drawback? You have to install the operating system and software yourself, configure it and protect it against attacks, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With static hostings, you can host static pages only, but it's free, and they manage all the operating system/web server/security issues themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one particular question, which made me choose GitHub over Cloudflare for pages hosting: how do I host several websites for different domains? GitHub docs got this topic covered, but I didn't find the answer in Cloudflare Pages' docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also chose Cloudflare for DNS hosting as it's free for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the transit was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move domains to Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move pages to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect pages on GitHub and domains at Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all. I paid some fees for domain transfer, and I also had to pay for my domains for another year, but that's a lot less than 156 USD. The timeframe was tight, so my plan B was to pay for another month and finish this procedure. Technically domain transfer takes some time, but all went well, and &amp;ndash; bye, shared web hosting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;P.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Dreamhost also charged me an additional 17 USD for domain registration. Yes, it was in the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

Vim's superpower is to move fast, really fast. To edit by commands with single keystrokes, cut, paste, find &amp;amp; replace the text at a maximum speed. Yes, there's some learning curve, but you can start with Vim mode in some editors and IDE and after learning Vim make use of Vim keystrokes in other programs, including Chromium, for example. Navigating and editing with the keyboard, without using a mouse will be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs' superpower is that you can get further than customizing, you can re-write the behavior of the editor using Lisp. As a demo of this deep customization or re-writing capabilities, you can use the Evil mode, which emulates Vim inside Emacs well. Emacs have modules for RSS reader, Telegram client, Media player, Email and Newsreader, IRC client, and more. The question with Emacs is actually "What do you want from it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim and Emacs are different regarding approaches to text editing: Vim is like "The editor does exactly what I type", while Emacs is more "Let me do that for you", like inserting closing parenthesis, formatting text, etc. But both editors are customizable to the extent that you can have &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt; the same behavior. Both have file managers nowadays. Emacs is an integrated environment to suit all your needs, while Vim sticks to the standards and there's an advanced mode to use Vim, (which I'll cover in this article) with a terminal multiplexer. To demonstrate the superpowers I'll take three use cases Markdown, HTML, note taking. I'm not a programmer and that's what I use on a day-to-day basis. I worked in Vim and Emacs for several months like 8 hours a day, so it's not a first impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is better as a GUI app, and Vim, from my viewpoint, is better in a terminal. Thus Vim has a life hack: if you have to work in Windows and you don't have privileges to install programs, you can install &lt;a href="https://gitforwindows.org/"&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Vim is included, so you can install any plugins and customize Vim further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll provide very basic configs I use, and I'd recommend learning both text editors, they are nice. When you are bothered, you can switch and have fun. :) For each use case, I'll try to describe briefly some useful functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Vim&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Emacs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Notes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki"&gt;VimWiki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nvim-orgmode.github.io/"&gt;Orgmode.nvim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg"&gt;Neorg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/"&gt;Org mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;HTML&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips"&gt;Snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;HTML mode&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Markdown&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown"&gt;Vim-markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips"&gt;Snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/"&gt;Markdown mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My configs are quite short, let's look at them, and then I'll explain everything line-by-line. So, my Vim config is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt; enable
&lt;span class="k"&gt;colorscheme&lt;/span&gt; monokai
&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;wrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;linebreak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nolist&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#begin&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;itchyny/lightline.vim&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SirVer/ultisnips&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;honza/vim-snippets&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;c-b&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;c-z&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;plasticboy/vim-markdown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;godlygeek/tabular&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;mattn/emmet-vim&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;laststatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;langmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ФИСВУАПРШОЛДЬТЩЗЙКЫЕГМЦЧНЯ;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;фисвуапршолдьтщзйкыегмцчня;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;conceallevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is my Emacs config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;scroll-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tool-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;menu-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default-frame-alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;undecorated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inhibit-startup-screen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dired-listing-switches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;-laGh1v&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;setq-default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;word-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sentence-end-double-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;custom-set-faces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Source Code Pro&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:foundry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ADBO&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:slant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;semi-bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;132&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;custom-theme-load-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;~/.emacs.d/themes/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load-theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;monokai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package-archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;melpa&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;custom-set-variables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;menu-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;package-selected-packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;markdown-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tool-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:custom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im-input-methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;russian-computer&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;recentf-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;global-set-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;C-x C-r&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;recentf-open-files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, that doesn't look too complicated. For Vim I add the color scheme, add a status line, and a soft word wrap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt; enable
&lt;span class="k"&gt;colorscheme&lt;/span&gt; monokai
&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;wrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;linebreak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nolist&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#begin&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;itchyny/lightline.vim&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix a bug with the status line and add mapping to Cyrillic keys (not to switch to Cyrillic in normal mode) we need to add this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;laststatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;langmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ФИСВУАПРШОЛДЬТЩЗЙКЫЕГМЦЧНЯ;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;фисвуапршолдьтщзйкыегмцчня;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Vim is launched in some terminals, I specify the font in the config for the terminal. Regarding Emacs, first, we need to switch off the menu (it's accessible with F10), and the scrollbar and switch off the window decoration to save some space. I also switch off the startup screen as it becomes annoying after a few launches. I turn on soft word wrap and make Dired, the file manager inside Emacs, look a bit prettier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;scroll-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tool-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;menu-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default-frame-alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;undecorated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inhibit-startup-screen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dired-listing-switches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;-laGh1v&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;setq-default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;word-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a theme and specify a custom font set I do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sentence-end-double-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;custom-set-faces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Source Code Pro&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:foundry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ADBO&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:slant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;semi-bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;132&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;custom-theme-load-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;~/.emacs.d/themes/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load-theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;monokai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't specify the font face manually, instead, I choose it from the menu and Emacs adds it to the config. For some reason Emacs thinks that sentences are divided using double spaces, so the first line is to fix it to be able to jump between sentences with Alt-E and Alt-A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a separate &lt;a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/reverse-im"&gt;reverse-im module&lt;/a&gt; to make hotkeys work with Cyrillic keymap, first, we need to add repositories and install 'package':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;#39;package-archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;melpa&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:custom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im-input-methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;russian-computer&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;reverse-im-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Markdown, let's take Vim first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snippets allow you to insert markup for almost everything (links, images, headers, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim-markdown allows folding, insert table of contents and also have TOC inside Vim to move faster between sections!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bullets auto-insert is also available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto table formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to install several plugins and set conceal level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#begin&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SirVer/ultisnips&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;honza/vim-snippets&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;c-b&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;c-z&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;plasticboy/vim-markdown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  Plug &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;godlygeek/tabular&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; plug#&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;conceallevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snippets are quite useful and some people don't get their full capabilities. For a link, for example, I enter '[c' and then Tab in Insert mode, then enter the name for the link, press Ctrl-B and then enter the URL. I also can get back to the link name with Ctrl-Z in Insert mode. Well, it doesn't work so well with links inside tables. :( Concealing also breaks formatting sometimes, like you have plenty of whitespace at the end of the line and some characters on the next line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs allows it all this plus a bit more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can automatically insert numbered list as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links concealing is a bit better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few more functions to work with headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is done in the Markdown package. Emacs adds lines to config itself, you need to run a package install command. I like Emacs' documentation a bit more because it's embedded into the code. In Vim you have to look at the actual snippet code, and in Emacs, I do Ctrl-H M to view all the up-to-date documentation for Markdown mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's simple, you need to insert tags, lots of tags. Emmet is available for Emacs, as for Vim. With Emmet you can enter ul&amp;gt;li*3 to insert an unordered list with 3 bullets. Emmet is a bit overkill for me, so I use embedded HTML mode in Emacs and snippets in Vim to insert paragraphs and some lists. For example, in Vim this could be 'p' and Tab, in Emacs Ctrl-C and then Enter. The workflow after that can be different, as in the terminal I can use xclip to copy a file to the buffer, in Vim you can do ':%y+' and in Emacs, you can do Ctrl-X H and then Alt+W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org mode generally is a reason to use and learn Emacs, and it's great. At first, I didn't get it so I started with VimWiki. I had to leave it towards Emacs for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with links in convenient ways matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big headers help a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know that I can have more dimensions: categories and tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of tools to work with org files also matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org mode is embedded, so you can just open an .org file and start experimenting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Vim you are welcome to try Orgmode.nvim and Neorg, they look promising, but I didn't try them. You can also use vim-markdown for note-taking, you'll be able to jump between files using links or preview HTML in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vim advanced mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'standard' Vim use is Gnome Terminal + Vim or GVim. What I call 'advanced' mode is a terminal multiplexer like Tmux + terminal (I prefer Alacritty) + Vim. It's a separate topic, how to set it up and use it, I'll just mention what it &lt;strong&gt;allows&lt;/strong&gt; you to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a terminal pane and a Vim pane inside one window and use Tmux to switch between windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have pre-defined sessions with pre-defined windows and panes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste a text from the terminal using the keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say that it's less disturbing to have everything in a terminal, as you don't switch the context. Just try it and decide for yourself. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is my choice at the moment because my acid test revealed that I can do more and get stressed less with Emacs. For example, I work a lot with links, and my workflow is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type some text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide that some words should become a link, so I select those words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert link target from the clipboard, Emacs just inserts all the markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suffer to do the same with snippets. I had a lot of mistakes with link markup, so I prefer the Emacs way to work with them as it's error-proof. Besides, Org mode was developed in Emacs and it's polished, and Emacs has a lot of export functions which saved a ton of time for me. I learned about Orgmode.nvim and Neorg doing quick research right before writing this article, they seem to be still under development, and I had no reason to switch from Emacs. Although I wrote this particular article in Vim just to be sure that my .vimrc works. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I've found a way to get almost the same in Vim finally: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/tqgcpw/comment/i2h9ivs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;UltiSnips + Visual mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Cooking Linux the right way: use cases the Unix-way</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-linux-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-28T11:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-28T11:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-28:/2022-09-linux-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting more productive with a native Linux environment&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of modern Linux you have several options to choose your use case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows-like (I don't mean it's bad), when you manipulate normal GUI windows using mouse and hotkeys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal-based, when you do everything in the command line and CLI apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiled, when you have GUI windows, but they are tiled or maximized and managed using hotkeys only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs-based, when you try to do inside Emacs as much as you like and Emacs manages its windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to use a mix, I do it, by the way. It's the question of comfort and your use cases. For example, when I edit audio, I use GUI apps only and I prefer a Windows-like approach, but when I edit the text I use as Emacs, as a command line in the Terminal. You are welcome to mix and try, you even don't need the virtual machine for that because for major distributions everything works well on the same installation. What's important, is that you &lt;strong&gt;have a choice&lt;/strong&gt;. In the Linux world, however, those who like tiled environments speak more for some reason, but it doesn't reflect the percentage of users, who use each approach on the desktop. OK, let's move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows-like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what traditional desktop environments are about: windows, windows titles, you move them and resize them with the mouse. What I like about Gnome, is that it has some tiling capabilities, I mean you can divide the screen into two parts, and sometimes it's useful. But I use a notebook with a 13-inch display, if you have a bigger screen you may need to tile more than two apps. So, it becomes a pain. I also like to work on one task at a time and a thus bigger screen will not fix my issues. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with a Windows-like environment is context switching, all the programs look different and the brain doesn't adapt well to it. You lose time and concentration, but it may be not so critical for you. It's also a productivity loss when you take an arm off the keyboard and start looking for a menu item with a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding particular desktop environments, I don't like KDE, because it had memory leakage problems. XFCE is supposed to be a lightweight Gnome version, but it becomes almost as heavyweight as Gnome, but lacking some important features. So, choosing XFCE or Gnome is a matter of taste and functionality. For example, XFCE doesn't support Wayland at the moment and Wayland &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; good. If you need to be lean with your system resources, you can try LXDE or LXQt, as they have maximum functions with a minimal CPU and memory footprint. It's also for X Windows system, regretfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Windows-like environment, you can use workspace and hotkeys to switch between them. To become more productive with my workspace, I use the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fixed number of workspaces (3), each with a specific purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch most apps on login automatically and place them on workspaces automatically as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not move apps between workspaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to use hotkeys everywhere you can, because a keyboard is a lot faster than a mouse. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extreme environment because it's text only and not so comfortable regarding user experience. Most terminal emulators lack GPU acceleration, so they lack smooth rendering. As everything is controlled with a keyboard and resource usage is minimal, it's the fastest way to get the job done if you have CLI apps only. No context switching, by the way. It becomes so comfortable over time, that you tend to evade GUI apps. But beware, people use Twitter and send images and links inside emails. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to master the command line anyway for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some things can be done significantly faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some things in Linux still can't be done using GUI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a remote server has SSH access only, your options are limited to CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next (but in fact really old) chapter in CLI evolution is terminal multiplexors like Screen and Tmux. They allow you to have windows (and tile them) and sessions, so you can save and restore several programs with some files opened for a specific use case, but only if they are CLI. :) Vim or NeoVim is a great CLI program, really a handy editor. You may want to change the color scheme or some key bindings, but generally, when you get its commands at your fingertips, it becomes extremely comfortable. It has a file manager and some programs try to use Vim bindings, even Chrome extensions. And in terminal font sizes are always the same, it matters when you work a lot at a computer, reducing fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tiled environment is good for big screens and looking at several apps at the same time. I don't have these use cases, so I just use maximized apps. Tiled environments have several drawbacks for me, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiling window managers don't support Wyland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are window managers, so they lack DE features: hardware controls and small useful programs I need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say that you can invest your time to get a more productive environment, you can also save configs to the cloud and install them fast on a new system. Well, for me it looks like you are studying ergonomics yourself and I don't consider it a good investment of time. I also can't understand why to set up things like hardware controls, that are present in the default Gnome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you expect from a text editor? Nice hotkeys, syntax highlighting, fast editing, maybe macros support. Emacs is not a text editor at all, it is an "elisp code execution environment"&amp;nbsp;(C). That means that any logic within Emacs can be customized and any program can be written inside Emacs. By the way, Emacs has a text-only version, but it's slow and sometimes it behaves strangely. Links insertion for me is a critical case: I'd like to have markup done automatically for links. Emacs does this in a series of questions like URL, link text, and link title. Vim wiki, for example, just inserts some markup and you move left or right to make a link actually. Emacs is really old and when you ask for anything text-based it's usually inside Emacs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Org-mode is like an internal wiki, which you can export to any format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split screen mode when you need to translate the text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in any &lt;strong&gt;mode&lt;/strong&gt; Emacs behaves differently and the same events trigger different functions, and... it's so nice! At first, I was dissatisfied that the &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; does something for me, like closing brackets. But then I relaxed and liked it because it works and it does the most important things in every mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, Emacs has windows (called buffers) inside and a file manager. You can also use its terminal emulator, RSS reader, and Telegram client, but for me, it's overkill. For example, I write an article for this blog, run the update command, then several git commands in the terminal and I don't experience problems switching between Emacs and Terminal. Besides, Gnome Terminal is really good. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a conclusion for Emacs it's worth trying and I'll mention a few essential customizations to an empty Emacs config file in the next article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to sum up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use windows-like environments for graphics-intensive programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a terminal environment if all your programs are CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a tiled environment if you need to look at several activities at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Emacs if you need more automation and customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's move to Emacs then. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Cooking Linux the right way: Gnome setup</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-linux-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-27T21:32:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-27T21:32:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-27:/2022-09-linux-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Revealing Gnome potential&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we'll go through the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up network accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting apps automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing apps automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor tuning: tray, clipboard, and desktop indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, let's do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up network accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a Google account, you may do it the old way: set your Gmail account in an email program or use a web interface for Gmail and Google Drive. Instead, you can do it once in Settings &amp;ndash; Online Accounts. After that, the following will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatible email programs like Geary and Evolution will show your mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nautilus will show your Google Drive as a folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, if you have another email account, Gnome-way is to add it in Online Accounts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Deja dup backup tool will require authorization to use Google Drive, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancing performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main trick here is to turn off animation. In Gnome version 2.42 it can be done in the Accessibility tab (I also turn on the large text setting there), before that it was in Gnome Tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also visit the Power tab in Settings to check power mode &amp;ndash; if you need performance, you can turn it on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting apps automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, starting apps manually at a system startup is a waste of time. I use gnome-tweak to start apps I need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nautilus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placing apps automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use workspaces. I limit the number of workspaces to three not to get confused (Settings &amp;ndash; Multitasking) and also turn on the setting 'Application Switching &amp;ndash; Include applications from the current workspace only'. Then you can install &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/"&gt;Auto Move Windows&lt;/a&gt; extension and set auto-started apps, for example, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal + text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nautilus + Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minor tuning: tray, clipboard, and desktop indicator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tray was required by Telegram and Skype, now it's used by Skype only. So, I still prefer to have a tray not to look for Skype when I need it and &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2890/tray-icons-reloaded/"&gt;Tray Icons: Reloaded&lt;/a&gt; extension does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clipboard history is essential when you do a lot of copy-paste actions, so extensions like &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4422/gnome-clipboard/"&gt;Gnome Clipboard&lt;/a&gt; allow you to choose what to paste. I'd rank this number 1 for productivity because instead of switching multiple times between the apps it allows me to copy multiple links, switch to another app and paste anything I want. By the way, two hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can select the path for copy-paste in Nautilus hitting Ctrl+L.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy-paste works in the Terminal with Ctrl+Shift+[С|V] by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to have a &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/21/workspace-indicator/"&gt;workspace indicator&lt;/a&gt; whether it's visual or just a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all, I wouldn't spoil Gnome too much with extensions when they begin to conflict with each other, consume memory, and crash. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this setup for heavy-duty copy-pasting at work, and it works fine for me. I even do not bother that the clipboard extension doesn't have a hotkey. For the rest just use hotkeys and everything will be fine. :) If you need more productivity, stay tuned for terminal and text editors setup.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Cooking Linux the right way: installing the right programs the right way</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-linux-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-27T16:37:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-27T16:37:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-27:/2022-09-linux-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Installing programs without religious prejudice&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm aiming at a "general desktop Linux user", which is non-existent by default, but if you use a computer, sooner or later you use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some desktop environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A messaging app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office apps to edit rich format texts, presentations, spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A backups program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minimal image editing program (crop and resize)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video, photo, and audio editors are considered special for each case, so nothing to see here. :) The same for IDEs and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the questions you probably have are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;strong&gt;the desktop environments&lt;/strong&gt; I use Gnome and I'd recommend it for the best desktop experience. The only exception could be a PC with limited resources and I'd rather use LXDE (LXQt) for that. Gnome is the one to support Wayland, and Wayland is great for the desktop vs. X Window system. The other Gnome 'pros' are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great look and feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequate resource usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of integrated tools and programs (notably screenshots, file manager, VPN client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great controls for hardware (battery, Bluetooth, sound, and brightness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnome extensions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a great terminal and a functional file manager, so the tuning you need here is gnome-tweaks and extensions. I'll cover Gnome setup in another article because it's where productivity matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome became a de-facto standard for &lt;strong&gt;web browsing&lt;/strong&gt;, so the same issue here: there are alternatives, but they all have some drawbacks in terms of speed and website compatibility. You could use Chromium to be Google-free, but then you need at least to add some password storage extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;messaging&lt;/strong&gt; you could use Slack or Telegram. I'd not recommend web clients, as they are less functional. Some users may require the bad old Skype, it's OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;text editing&lt;/strong&gt; the choice is wide, but to unleash the true Linux power (see the next article) you could install Vim and Emacs. They are great, I used both, although I'm writing this text inside Emacs. I had some problems with big texts in Geany, so I'd rather install some Electron-powered modern text editor if you edit plaintext-based files often. Even Visual Studio Code would do. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to &lt;strong&gt;edit office documents&lt;/strong&gt; in Google Docs, but if you need to edit something fast or view the document on the local disk it's handy to have something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPS is recommended, I tested it and liked the most for compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OnlyOffice is limited if you use office features heavily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice sometimes does the things others can't, so I still have it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, don't forget to install MS TTF core fonts to display presentations and rich format documents as it's intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;backups&lt;/strong&gt; I use Deja Dup, it saved my digital life twice already: in cases of accidental folder deletion and HDD failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;edit images&lt;/strong&gt; quickly (screenshots and memes) I use gThumb. Maybe there's a better alternative, I'm just quite satisfied with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also install VLC as it has all the codecs for &lt;strong&gt;playing video&lt;/strong&gt; from the local drive, although most of the videos are online nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install programs properly we need to put them into two baskets: (1) when new features are critical and (2) when they are not. For office applications and messaging I'd say that new features are critical because it's all about compatibility. So the approaches are different for each category: we install the first category using flatpak, as it's isolated and won't ruin the system; it's also updated well. And we use a standard package manager (apt for Debian-based systems and dnf for RedHat-based) for all the rest packages to minimize resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to &lt;a href="https://flatpak.org/setup/"&gt;add a flatpak catalog&lt;/a&gt; (or install flatpak first if it's not present). After that, we can install packages using instructions on &lt;a href="https://flathub.org/home"&gt;flathub page&lt;/a&gt;. So, we install the following using flatpak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPS Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype (in case you need it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OnlyOffice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can combine it in one command, just be sure to type the program names right. For the rest of the programs we do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo [apt|dnf] install gnome-tweaks vim emacs deja-dup gthumb vlc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome is easy to download and install from the official website. That's all for the programs installations, stay tuned for Gnome and core editors setup.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Cooking Linux the right way: choosing the distribution</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-linux-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-15T12:58:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-15T12:58:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-15:/2022-09-linux-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone has to write the truth on how to use Linux&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is great for a server, but it's still a challenge for a desktop. The server requires stability and minimal resource usage, but does anybody know what the desktop requires? I used Linux at home for 20 years and I used it at work for several months, so in my viewpoint the following is important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware support; you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; know beforehand, whether the hardware is supported and choose the compatible hardware; so, it's better to have a wider choice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software availability: you &lt;strong&gt;will not know&lt;/strong&gt; beforehand, what software you need for the desktop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known issues and solutions database aka community support and documentation availability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you value your time and prefer to get the job done (whether it's a hobby or a payable job) vs. fixing and tuning, according to my experience deb or rpm package formats are preferable. Hardware manufacturers distribute drivers and accompanying software in these formats, and commercial software manufacturers also prefer them. Some software is available in deb and not available in rpm and vice versa, but on average you can find a package you need in these two formats. Arch and Manjaro users suffer here, but you are welcome to install these in a virtual environment and play as much as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software availability issue is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; fixed with the help of Flatpak and &lt;a href="https://flathub.org/"&gt;Flathub&lt;/a&gt;: you can have fresh software on any distribution now, but for a limited number of programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the list of distributions I'd list the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Package format&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Stable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Unstable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rpm&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://rockylinux.org/"&gt;Rocky Linux&lt;/a&gt; (CentOS)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried 3 of 4: Fedora as my main system at home, Ubuntu at work, and Debian for a few months at home. But first, a few words concering the 'stability'. Yes, it's about the number of bugs, which lead to system faults and excessive resource consumption, but 'stable' distributions are also less user-friendly. Let's go through the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rocky Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a successor for CentOS, which was very popular among scientists because scientists need to get the job done, they also need stability and they need it cheap. I can't say anything bad about it, maybe it doesn't have the latest software like Gnome, which is important for desktop users. Debian &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian#Don.27t_suffer_from_Shiny_New_Stuff_Syndrome"&gt;warns us&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't suffer from Shiny New Stuff Syndrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can fully admit that when you need to just get the job done, new shiny animations matter less than stability. With Rocky Linux, you can also fully benefit from &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/"&gt;Red Hat Linux documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don't need this stability at home, so why not be on the edge with Fedora?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is great for servers, I tried it at home and it lacks hardware support and some essential desktop features, like VPN support in Network Manager. It requires more effort in cases that require no effort in Fedora and Ubuntu. When my hard disk died, I decided to return to Fedora. I liked Debian for stability and low resource usage, but small desktop issues are disturbing and hard to fix. I mean suspend mode works not so well, wi-fi needs time to connect after suspend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware support, some hardware manufacturers tend to have old software, so the software for my MFD worked in Debian, although it didn't work in Ubuntu and Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to combine Debian stability with the latest software versions from Flatpak, but for the desktop that wasn't enough, regretfully. You are trying to do desktop things on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu works, but it seems that it was designed by marketing managers instead of engineers. It's heavily patched and these patches bring more bugs: more resource usage, less speed, and stability. It feels like windows if you missed it. I didn't get it, I tried to fix it by installing 'vanilla' software versions. Yes, it worked, but I didn't like it. For me, it seems that some solutions in Ubuntu are dead: Snap and Unity. At the end of the day, Ubuntu takes solutions from Fedora: Gnome, pipewire audio system. With Ubuntu, you just wait for technologies to migrate from Fedora. Still, some bugs are fixed and Ubuntu generally is more stable, than Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I consider the deb package format outdated, I had to fix corrupted dependencies several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora's way to fix things is like "let's invent another system". We don't like pulseaudio, let's make pipewire. We don't like deb, let's make rpm. We don't like yum, let's make dnf. It works in major versions, but it brings lots of bugs in the beginning. The kernel is so fresh, that it breaks hardware compatibility: during three years I had two severe bugs, last time wi-fi stopped working. And this high pace of progress is not going to stop. Too fresh software? We have a new answer: &lt;a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;immutable linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding community it's smaller than Ubuntu's one, so sometimes you have to look for answers on Ubuntu (or Arch) wiki and forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to recommend anything from the list, Fedora requires less effort after installation and works well for me. If you read this, it means that my wi-fi card worked. :) We'll look at a minimal software list for any distribution and apps to unleash the true Linux power in the next episodes, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Obsidian And Others</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-obsidian-and-others.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-14T21:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-14T21:56:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-14:/2022-09-obsidian-and-others.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it smells like knowledge base, I can't just pass by&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nothing special, just everyone on YouTube admires Obsidian so much to manage knowledge and notes.

&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still going to use Obsidian, just a reminder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not opensource, so nobody can say, where this app sends your data to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a service to publish your notes, but it's not the same as a web app for team notes; it works vice versa: a web app (Dokuwiki, for example) can be installed on a local computer, as on a server but in personal mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't get the idea of the relationship diagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokuwiki is just an example, some people recommend &lt;a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; if you need Zettelkasten exactly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vimwiki and Emacs can help a lot with Markdown files: adding links, tables, and lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also recommend the services with backups included vs. personal note-taking programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="emacs"></category></entry><entry><title>Germany Transport System</title><link href="https://en.kovchinnikov.info/2022-09-germany-transport.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-12T23:14:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-12T23:14:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Konstantin Ovchinnikov</name></author><id>tag:en.kovchinnikov.info,2022-09-12:/2022-09-germany-transport.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hacking through transport associations and Deutche Bahn&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German trains, buses, and routes system is rather specific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Without mobile apps, which update routes in real-time, it's hard to get somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 3 hours of my own time, it was quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the transport system works in Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite clear with the railways: there are suburban trains and fast intercity trains (IC and others). Faster trains cost more, and suburban trains are cheaper. For example, the DB app has a setting "show our best prices" &amp;ndash; most likely, it will use suburban trains and buses (the price of buses is not counted in DB apps, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found only &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations"&gt;one picture&lt;/a&gt; with the bus associations, which only &lt;strong&gt;approximately&lt;/strong&gt; shows the location of each association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are zones inside each transport association, ticket price will depend on the number of zones you cross: the further you get = the more you pay. If you buy a ticket for 5 zones, but ride 6, it's a violation. Besides, each association has travel cards for a week and a month. The tickets should be sold in machines and on the buses (from the driver), but in the worst case, you can buy tickets only on the buses and only for cash. Advanced associations have their mobile apps, and less advanced have a website with tariffs only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an experiment in the summer of 2022: a travel card for all suburban trains and buses for 9 euros. It made the rides cheaper, more than that, it made it easier to plan the trip and calculate its cost. The experiment is over, it will not be continued, and travel cards are introduced in some regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to find prices for buses in a particular region&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how to buy a ticket, how much the tickets cost, and what tickets are available, you need to find a particular transport association for a region. The algorithm is (approximately) the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the name of the association on the bus or on the station, often the title is large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find which region the town belongs to and find the name of the association by the name of the region, like &lt;a href="https://www.bus-clp.de"&gt;VGC&lt;/a&gt; for Cloppenburg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it didn't help, define the association using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations"&gt;the scheme&lt;/a&gt;, then visit its map and locate your town there. Thus you make sure, that your town belongs to this transport association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you can locate the website of the transport association and find all the necessary information there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What mobile apps to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll provide links to the two apps, which were sufficient for me (for Android):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=offi&amp;amp;c=apps"&gt;Offi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=db%20navigator&amp;amp;c=apps"&gt;DB Navigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we look at the app/website of a particular transport association, for example, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.vgv"&gt;Moobil+&lt;/a&gt; to order a minibus in the VGC zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB Navigator is great, except for two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It plans the routes for a different time of the day, but doesn't show different routes visually on the time scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't show local minibusses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offi fixes these two issues, and besides, it's updated in real-time (actual movement of a particular train). Some more optimized route variants may exist regarding the price and the trip duration, Google Maps may show them or you can ask locals. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB Navigator app is great, but to buy tickets you need to register... on another website. Once you've done it and have connected a payment card, you can buy tickets easily and view the trains on the route online. It's the basic level, after that you can buy discount cards and travel cards. For example, there is a ticket "any 10 days within 30 days" or a travel card for a month, but you need to search for two points. There were no offers for points I looked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without one of these apps, it's difficult to get somewhere. For example, trains are delayed, so instead of a train at 15:55 another train comes, you take it and go in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB is worthy of a separate article, and it has some tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enter several persons, and it shows beneficial offers for a particular route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can buy tickets, which are unavailable in the machines at a railway station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my experience, it's better to buy beforehand, it can be almost twice as cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, machines on a railway station don't switch to English, but the app does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ask your questions, I have enough time for practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="Germany"></category></entry></feed>
